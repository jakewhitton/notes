# Notes

This repository is for my note-taking in school.  I am currently in 12th grade(Senior year in High School), and I'm trying to develop a robust note-taking system using markdown and some bash scripts.

The repository is divided into directories for each year in school, which is subsequently divided into courses.  Each course directory should be divided into units or chapterrs, and each unit/chapter directory contains markdown files for each day.  I've created a script to compile each day's notes into a master document.

I'm still trying to learn all the minutiae of markdown, but its pretty easy so far.

If you see anything you like, feel free to use it yourself.  It's a learning process for me, but hopefully I can help someone out there.
