## Charge Is Conserved
- In physics, almost *everything* is conserved
    * the same holds true for **charge**
- Charge acts like mass in classical Newtonian physics
- **Conservation of Charge** = a hypothesis put forth by Benjamin Franklin that asserts the prior is the case
- Examples
    * Nuclear decay
        + Whenever a decay event occurs, the newly created particles always have an overall charge that is equal to that of the parent particle
            - $^{238}$U $\to$ $^{234}$Th + $^{4}$He
        + **Annihilation** = two particles colliding and destroying each other
            - Charge is perserved
        + **Pair Production** = the spontaneous creation of particles from existing energy
            - $\gamma \to$ e$^{-}$ + e$^{+}$
