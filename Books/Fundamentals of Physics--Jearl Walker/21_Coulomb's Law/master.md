### What is Physics?
- **Physics** = the study of physical phenomenon and the mechanisms that cause them
    * This class is focused on **electromagnetism**
- Physics first discovered by the Greek philosophers
    * Rub piece of amber and it "pulls" straw near it
- **Hans Christian Oersted** = physicist who discovered the *unity* of electricity and magnetism(~1820)
    * Prior to this, the two phenomenon were assumed to be independent of one another
- **Michael Faraday** = physicist that pioneered much of the properties of electromagnetism
    * Didn't break these laws down into concrete formulas
        + Physicists *love* them some formulas
- **James Clerk Maxwell** = physicist who made Faraday's discoveries more conrete
    * Created **Maxwell's Equations**
        + **Gauss's Law**
$$ \nabla \cdot \textbf{E} = \frac{\rho}{\epsilon_0} $$
        + **Gauss's Law for Magnetism**
$$ \nabla \cdot \textbf{B} = 0 $$
        + **Faraday's Law of Induction**
$$ \nabla \times \textbf{E} = - \frac{\delta \textbf{B}}{\delta t} $$
        + **Ampere's Circuital Law**
$$ \nabla \times \textbf{B} = \mu_0 \big( \textbf{J} + \epsilon_0 \frac{\delta \textbf{E}}{\delta t} \big) $$
- **Benjamin Franklin** = American scientist
    * Credited with describing the two electric charges as "positive" and "negative"
    * Also introduced the idea of **excess charge**
        + **Excess charge** = an imbalance in positive and negative charge

### Conductors and Insulators
- **Conductor** = a material that permits electrons to move relatively freely
    * **Superconductors** = a material that acts as a *perfect* conductor
        + Offers no resistance to electric flow
    * Generally, conductors have electrons on the outer shells whose ionization energy is small
- **Insulators** = a material that blocks electrons from moving freely
    * Also called **nonconductors**
- **Semiconductor** = a material whose capacity to permit electrons to move freely is in between **insulators** and **conductors**
- **Induced charge** = a phenomenon in which an object's internal electric field will orient itself to align with an external electric field and create a **dipole**
    * **Dipole** = an object that is positively charged on one side and negatively charged on the other

### Coulomb's Law
- **Electrostatic force** = the force that charged particles exert on one another
    * Vector quantity--the direction always points towards or away from the particle in question
- **Coulomb's Law** = an equation that describes the magnitude of the **electrostatic force**
    * Named after Charles-Augustin de Coulomb
    * Discovered in 1785
$$\vec{F} = k \frac{q_1 q_2}{r^2} \hat{r}$$
$$\vec{F} = \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \frac{q_1 q_2}{r^2} \hat{r}$$
$$k = \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} = 9.99 \times 10^9 \frac{N m^2}{C^2}$$
$$\epsilon_0 = 8.85 \times 10^{-12} \frac{C^2}{N m^2}$$
    * $\epsilon_0$ is called the **permittivity constant**
        + Mostly used for historical reasons, as it made simplifying other equations easier
    * Very similar to equation for Newtonian gravity
$$\vec{F_g} = G \frac{m_1 m_2}{r^2} \hat{r}$$

#### Electric Charge and Current
- SI unit for charge is **Coulomb(C)**
    * For practical reasons, the **Coulomb** is defined using the **Ampere**
- **Ampere** = SI unit for current
    - Current is defined as the following, where $i$ is current and $q$ is charge
$$i = \frac{dq}{dt}$$
