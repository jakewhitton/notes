### What is Physics?
- **Physics** = the study of physical phenomenon and the mechanisms that cause them
    * This class is focused on **electromagnetism**
- Physics first discovered by the Greek philosophers
    * Rub piece of amber and it "pulls" straw near it
- **Hans Christian Oersted** = physicist who discovered the *unity* of electricity and magnetism(~1820)
    * Prior to this, the two phenomenon were assumed to be independent of one another
- **Michael Faraday** = physicist that pioneered much of the properties of electromagnetism
    * Didn't break these laws down into concrete formulas
        + Physicists *love* them some formulas
- **James Clerk Maxwell** = physicist who made Faraday's discoveries more conrete
    * Created **Maxwell's Equations**
        + **Gauss's Law**
            - $$ \nabla \cdot \textbf{E} = \frac{\rho}{\epsilon_0} $$
        + **Gauss's Law for Magnetism**
            - $$ \nabla \cdot \textbf{B} = 0 $$
        + **Faraday's Law of Induction**
            - $$ \nabla \times \textbf{E} = - \frac{\delta \textbf{B}}{\delta t} $$
        + **Ampere's Circuital Law**
            - $$ \nabla \times \textbf{B} = \mu_0 \big( \textbf{J} + \epsilon_0 \frac{\delta \textbf{E}}{\delta t} \big) $$
