### Electric Field Due to a Point Charge
- Because the strength of the electric field at any given point is
$$\vec{E} = \frac{\vec{F}}{q_0}$$
- we can substitute our particle of charge $q_0$ to get a formula to use:
$$|\vec{E}| = \frac{\frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \frac{qq_0}{r^2}}{q_0}$$
$$|\vec{E}| = \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \frac{q}{r^2}$$
- This formula allows to calculate the *magnitude* of the electric field at any given point
    * Note that this formula doesn't use $q_0$; we can calculate $\vec{E}$ independent of any empirical data
- Because forces obey superposition(the permittability of treating a vector sum as representative of the whole), we can demonstrate that the electric field obeys superposition
$$ \vec{E} = \frac{\sum \vec{F}_i}{q_0}$$
$$ \vec{E} = \frac{\vec{F}_1 + \vec{F}_2 + \vec{F}_3 + ... + \vec{F}_n}{q_0} $$
$$ \vec{E} = \frac{\vec{F}_1}{q0} + \frac{\vec{F}_2}{q0} + ... + \frac{\vec{F}_n}{q0} $$
