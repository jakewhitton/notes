### Electric Field Due to a Line of Charge
- WARNING: this is largely considered the hardest part of the class; BRACE YOURSELF
- Prior to this, we calculated $\vec{E}$ mostly in the context of simple particle systems
    * Now, we consider when the systems include arbitrarily large number of particles in certain configurations
- When dealing with more complex particle systems, charge is often described in terms of **charge densities** rather than through the summation of each particle's individual charge
    * This permits us to use calculus to calculate what the sum would be from individual particles

#### The Problem
- Imagine a non-conducting circle of radius $R$ with a uniform positive charge about its circumference
- Consider a point P that is located on the line perpendicular to the plane of the circle that passes through its center point
    * Define $z$ as the distance along that line between the point P and the center of the circle 
- Imagine that the charge along the circumference can be described with a **linear charge density**
    * The symbol for **linear charge density** is $\lambda$
    * There are also **surface charge density** and **volume charge density**
        + **Surface charge density** = a metric that associates areas with how much charge one should expect to find in any given area
            - Symbol is $\sigma$
        + **Volume charge density** = a metric that associates volumes with how much charge one should expect to find in any given area
            - Symbol is $\rho$
- Define $ds$ as the differential length along the circumference of the circle
    * This is what we will input into our **linear charge density** to figure out how much charge is in that strecth of circumference
- Define $d\vec{E}$ as the differential electric field vector that is associated with the stretch of circumference of length $ds$

##### First Step
- Question: *How are we going to deal with a particle system with so many particles?  What if we don't even know how many particles there are?*
    * Answer: we are going to split the circumference into infinitesimally small segments of length $ds$.  We will treat each of these as their own particles
        + We can do this because $\vec{E}$ obeys the principle of superposition

##### Second Step
- Question: *How are we going to have all the $\vec{E}$ that we calculate summed up into one net $\vec{E}$?*
    * Answer: we are going to separate all of our $\vec{E}$ vectors into components that can be summed at the end of the problem.

##### Third Step
- Question: *How are we going to sum all of the $\vec{E}$ components?*
    * Answer: we will use integration

#### Solving the Problem
- Consider the following
$$ dq = \lambda ds $$
- This just means that the differential charge for our infinitesimal stretch of circumference will be equal to our **linear charge density** multiplied by the differential length
    * If you think about the units, it makes perfect sense
$$ (C) = \frac{C}{m} * m $$
- Considering the stretch of length $ds$, we can see that it will exert a $d\vec{E}$ on point P according to the one-particle system formula
$$ \vec{E} = \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \frac{q}{r^2} $$
- Adapting it to our situation, $\vec{E} = d\vec{E}$, $q = \lambda ds$, and $\epsilon_0$ is just the permittivity constant
- However, we do not know $r$, the distance from the source particle and the point in question.
    * We know that the point lies on the line perpendicular to the plane of the circle that passes through the center point
    * We know the circle is of radius $R$, and the length between the center point and P is $z$
    * From this information, we can make a right triangle of side lengths $R$ and $z$ and hypotenuse $r$
        + $r$ can be found with the pythagorean theorem
$$ c^2 = a^2 + b^2 $$
$$ r^2 = R^2 + z^2 $$
$$ r = \sqrt{R^2 + z^2} $$
- Making those substitutions,
$$ d\vec{E} = \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \frac{\lambda ds}{\bigg( \sqrt{R^2 + z^2} \bigg)^2} $$
$$ d\vec{E} = \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \frac{\lambda ds}{(R^2 + z^2)} $$
- Recall the right triangle formed between P, the center of the circle, and the point on the circumference
    * You can see that the $d\vec{E}$ exerted on P is some angle $\theta$ from the vertical
    * If you imagine the right triangle with the point on the exact opposite side of the circle, you can see that the two $d\vec{E}$ vectors have horizontal components that cancel each other out
        + This proves true for all points on the circumference
            - This means we only have to sum the vertical components... HURRAY!
- Imagine a new right triangle that is created when you superimpose $d\vec{E}$ onto P with $\theta$ from the vertical
    * The horizontal component is equal to $d\vec{E}cos(\theta)$
- So, our net $\vec{E}$ is just the sum of of all the $d\vec{E}cos(\theta)$ about the circle
    * But $\theta$ isn't a variable we are integrating with respect to; we need to define it in terms of existing variables
        + Imagine the triangle linking P, the center of the circle, and the charged particle on the circumference.  The angle with vertex P has a magnitude of $\theta$
        + From there, we know that $cos(\theta)$ is just the adjacent length over the hypotenuse length
$$ cos(\theta) = \frac{z}{\sqrt{R^2 + z^2}} $$
        + We can substitute this definition of $cos(\theta)$ into our earlier formula
$$ \vec{E} = \sum \bigg( \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \frac{\lambda ds}{(R^2 + z^2)} \bigg) \frac{z}{\sqrt{R^2 + z^2}} $$
- Now, we need to bust out the calculus
    * We've defined the differential $\vec{E}$, and now the following tautology spells the way
$$ \vec{E} = \int d\vec{E} $$
- Now, we can use our definition of $d\vec{E}$ to make the integral concrete
    * Since we determined that the horizontal components cancel each other out, we will just solve for the magnitude of $\vec{E}$, so that it makes our integral simpler
$$ |\vec{E}| = \int_{0}^{2 \pi} \bigg[ \bigg( \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \frac{\lambda}{(R^2 + z^2)} \bigg) \frac{z}{\sqrt{R^2 + z^2}} \bigg] ds $$
- Notice that our integrand does not contain $s$, nor any variables at all--they're all constants!
    * This means we can just take the entire integrant(without the $ds$, of course) outside of the integral
        + Easiest integral ever...
$$ |\vec{E}| = \frac{\lambda z}{4 \pi \epsilon_0 \bigg( R^2 + z^2 \bigg)^{\frac{3}{2}}} \int_{0}^{2 \pi} ds $$
$$ |\vec{E}| = \frac{\lambda z}{4 \pi \epsilon_0 \bigg( R^2 + z^2 \bigg)^{\frac{3}{2}}} \times (2 \pi) $$
$$ |\vec{E}| = \frac{\lambda z}{2 \epsilon_0 \bigg( R^2 + z^2 \bigg)^{\frac{3}{2}}}$$
