# Wherefore art thou, context switch?
- In general, times when a user program is interrupted are split into three
  categories
    1. Exceptions = *unintended* interruptions that happen because what is
    happening in the user program
    2. System calls = *intended* interruptions that happen because what is
    happening in the user program
    3. Interrupts = interruptions that happen because of some peripheral event
    that has nothing to do with what is happening in the user program
- **trap** = a term that sometimes refer to any one of of these three
  categories, but can also refer specifically to exceptions

## Tale of a keyboard interrupt
- The kernel has all kinds of facilities for setting what kinds of interrupts it
  wants to handle and when
- **driver** = some piece of kernel code that manages interactions with an I/O
  device
    * Usually split into two conceptual parts
        + **top** = the part of the driver that implements some syscall
        interface for that device
        + **bottom** = the part of the driver that handles interrupts from that
        device
        + Since the interrupts happen asynchrounously, some kind of
        synchronization scheme is necessary within the two halves of a driver
- Hardware for supporting interrupts
    * **sstatus** = supervisor status register
    * **sie** = supervisor interrupt enable register
    * **sip** = interrupt pending register
    * **scause** = stores the information about the cause for the interrupt
    * **stvec** = stores the program counter to return to after handling the
    interrupt
