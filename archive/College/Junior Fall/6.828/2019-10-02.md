# Process switching
- *how do we make sure that user programs share CPU time without requiring cooperation from user program?*
    * The kernel can switch the currently running userspace program *only* when
    in kernel mode
    * Sometimes, that process can happen in a syscall routine (*e.g.* yielding
    time given by scheduler when waiting for an I/O event

## Process state
- Every user thread has a corresponding thread in kernel space
    * A thread in kernel space essentially just means a stack and then a region
    for backing up kernel register state
        + The region for backing up kernel register state is for permitting
        kerneltraps
- The kernel in xv6 (at least conceptually) has a few threads running
    * A main thread that performed init directly after the bootloader
    * A scheduler thread
    * A thread for each user thread that could be scheduled
        + A kernel can switch from one kernel thread to another by calling
        `swtch`
            - This is responsible for backing up the context of the kernel
              thread (specifically its registers)
