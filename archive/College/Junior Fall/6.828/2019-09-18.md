# Shared Memory and Isolation
- The presence of multiple processes sharing one physical memory introduces
  difficulties enforcing isolation between processes
- Strategies for enforcing isolation
    * Construct programs in a way that ensures that memory boundaries are
      respected
        + Con: *What if someone writes a program that doesn't play nice with
          that?*
    * Use **virtual memory**
        + **Virtual memory** = a scheme for mapping virtual addresses to
          physical addresses using page tables
        + Con: some amount of hardwawre support is necessary for ensuring the
        translation is performed when it needs to happen
            - **MMU** = memory management unit; responsible for performing the
              translation


## Benefits of virtual memory
- Because the resolution process only depends on state stored in physical
  memory, the kernel can directly manipulate that state to implement
  optimizations and features
    * *e.g.* COW, lazy allocation, *etc*
