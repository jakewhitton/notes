# Filesystem logging
- One design challenge of operating systems is guaranteeing that system is
  never left in an inconsistent state
    * This is required, because there are no guarantees that the system won't
      crash at any given point
- One very effective strategy for remedying this is **logging**
    * **Logging** = the strategy of
        + Benifits
            - Atomic fs calls
            - Fast recovery upon crash
            - High perforance (if implemented intelligently)

## What happens on a write in a logging filesystem?
1. Log all writes involved in some atomic commit record
    * Essentially, write data updates along with location they should be put
2. Write commit record
3. Apply commit record
4. Remove commit record (by zeroing commit block)

## What happens on a crash in a logging filesystem?
1. Check if there are commit records on the disk
2. If there are blocks to be written, rewrite them
