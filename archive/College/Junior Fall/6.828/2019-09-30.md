# Multicore parallelism
- Moore's law is beginning to break down
    * Modern strategies to accelerate workloads involve parallelism in some form
    or another
- Modern OS's supply **synchronization primitives**
    * **Synchronization primitive** = a syscall that alllows coordination of
    access to program state or timing between user threads or between processes
        + *e.g.* semaphores, mutex's, barriers, *etc.*

## Lock granularity
- **Coarse-grain locking** = a strategy for synchronization which involves
  having a small set of locks that regulate a lot of concurrent code paths at
  once
    * Pros: easy to write, harder to disobey locking discipline
    + Cons: many threads competing for one lock leads to poor throughput
- **Fine-grain locking** = a strategy for synchronization which involves having
  a large set of locks that aim to regulate a smaller set of competing threads
    * Pros: faster
    * Cons: harder to write
    * *So, fine-grain locking is always the best strategy?*
        + Well, no.  Sometimes, the overhead of parallelism is significant
        enough in comparison to the benefits that a single threaded approach is
        best
            - It really depends on the specifics of the workload and the
              hardware that you're running on

## How do we write properly synchronized code?
1. Write code that is semantically correct if serial execution is guaranteed
2. Guarantee serial execution by inserting synchronization primitives
    * In general, it's wise to start with coarser-grain locks and *then* move
    towards finer grain locks if you observe that execution is bottlenecking in
    a way that limits overall throughput of your system
        + `Premature optimization is the greatest evil`

## How do operating systems implement locks
- Naive approach doesn't work, because C doesn't have a facility for making sure
- Copilers and CPUs can actually reorder
    * **Memory model** = a set of legal modifications to a program's access pattern
      of memory
        + RISC-V has a very relaxed memory model, which permits all kinds of
        reordering
- In order to sidestep thene memory reorders, instruction sets usually provide
  **atomic instructions**
    * **Atomic instructions** = an instruction in an ISA can read from memory,
    perform an operation, and then write to memory, all atomically
        + *e.g.* SWAP
    * **Fence** = a RISC-V instruction that imposes constraints on the
    reordering of memory accesses
