## Memory and State
- Future digital systems that we design should be capable of keeping **state**
    * **State** = a specific configuration of internal memory
- Specification of desired element
    * Three terminals
        1. **Next state** = input where feedback state is funneled
        2. **Load/Write** = input that specifies whether next state should be written
        3. **Current state** = output that specifies prior state

### Using Capacitors
- Use FET device to control access toa capacitor
    * "Write" means access capacitor and charge the capacitor at a certain voltage
    * "Read" means access capacitor and read voltage

### Using Inverters
- Use two inverters where the second inverter output feeds into the first inverter input in a perpetual loop
    * Called **bistable storage element**
    * State is kept continuously in the wire between the inverters

### Using Muxes
- **Latch** = a mux where output is fed back into one of the inputs
