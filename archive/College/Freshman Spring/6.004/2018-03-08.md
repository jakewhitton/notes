## Instruction Sets

### Von Neumann Model
- **Von Neumann Model** = a model for a general computation engine
- **Control FSM** = circuitry which coordinates the actions the datapath performs
- **Datapath** = circuitry for performing actions
    * Like the ALU
- **Main Memory** = a larger memory space that datapath may query
- **Input/Output** = additional information the datapath can query

#### Central Idea: Instructions are Data
- Individual instructions are held in the same main memory as the data being operated on
    * Potential for manipulating instructions at runtime?
- **Opcode** = first section of an instruction which encodes the operation the instruction represents
- **Word** = a unit that represents one value that can be extracted from memory
    * Instructions are typically one word
    * Data is typically one word
- **Load/Store Architecture** = the only permissible operations we can perform with memory are to load data from or to store data to memory

### Instruction Set Architecture
- Functional specification about what instructions are available and what registers can be written to and read from

### Types of Instructions
1. ALU instructions
2. Loads and stores instructions
3. Brahcning instructions
