## Lecture 21: Solubility and Intro to Acid-Base Chemistry

### Mixtures vs Solutions
- **Mixtures** = any combination of two or more substances
    * Mixtures can be **homogenous** or **heterogeneous**
        + **Homogeneous** = uniform throughout; well-mixed
        + **Heterogeneous** = not uniform throughout; not perfectly mixed
- **Solution** = a special term for a homogenous mixture

### Sollubility
- Mantra goes "like dissolves like"
    * This means that polar/ionic compounds dissolve polar/ionic compounds, whereas nonpolar compounds dissolve nonpolar compounds
- **$K_{SP}$** = a metric of the equilibrium point for which a compound dissolves
    * *eg.* For
$$ AB(s) \to A^+(aq) + B^-(aq), $$
$$ K_{SP} = [A^+][B^-] $$
    * Note that $[AB]$ isn't included in calculation, because it is **solid**
 
#### $\Delta G_{sol}$ and $\Delta H_{sol}$
- $K_{SP}$ is an indication of what the Gibbs Free Energy change over the course of dissolving
    * High $K_{SP}$ indicates spontenaity and negative $\Delta G_{sol}$
- You can measure $\Delta H_{sol}$ and use the equation of Gibbs free energy to do additional analysis
$$ \Delta G = \Delta H - T \Delta S $$

#### Sollubility of Gasses
- **Henry's Law** = the sollubility of a gas is directly proportional to it's partial pressure
$$ C = k P_{gas} $$ 

### Acid-Base Chemistry
* Arrhenius definition
    + **Arrhenius acid** = substance that increases the concentration of hydronium($H_3O^+$)
    + **Arrhenius base** = substance that increases the concentration of hydroxide($OH^-$)
* Bronsted-Lowry definition
    + **Bronsted-Lowry acid** = a proton donor
    + **Bronsted-Lowry base** = a proton acceptor
* **Conjugate pair** = the corresponding acid/base which is created when a base/acid is neutralized
