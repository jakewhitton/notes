### Linkage
- **Linkage** = an effect of when genes are arranged linearly on a chromosome
    * If they are in proximity on chromosome, they become *linked*
        + This means that they will sort *dependently*

### Crossing Over
- During aligning of chromosomes in meiosis, if genes aren't linked, individual alleles can swap over
    * The class of gametes with with these swapped alleles are called **recombinant**
    * **Recombinant frequency** = the percentage of gametes that are recombinant
        + The closer two genes are, the less likely the genes are to cross over
            - This means that the recombinant frequency will be lower
        + We can use recombinant frequences to get the distance between gene sequences on the chromosome
