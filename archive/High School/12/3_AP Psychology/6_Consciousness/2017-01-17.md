### Hypnosis
- **Hypnosis** = a state of intense relaxation where attention is directed on very particular things
    * Psychologists believe its power is related to the power of *suggestion* to direct focus in certain way
    * **Trances** = periods of time that the subject focuses on becoming more relaxed
        + *Go down, down into the rabit hole*
    * **Posthypnotic amnesia** = thought to be the inability to retrieve memories of what occurred during hypnosis
    * **Orne & Evans** = a group of researchers that studied hypnotic states in 1965
        + Control group was to "pretend" to be hypnotized
        + Experimental group received actual hypnosis
        + Result: no substantial difference
    * **Posthypnotic suggestion** = something that a hypno-therapist embeds in the subconscious to be done after the hypnotic state ends

#### Two Theories of Hypnosis
- **Divided Consciousness Theory** = a theory that explains hypnotic behavior as a split in what different conscious elements of the brain are doing at any given time
    * If things are happening in parallel, the idea is that not all sensations will get through to the conscious mind
    * **Hidden observer** = a kind of third person perspective that subjects take on when hypnotized
        + Can explain how subjects don't feel pain
