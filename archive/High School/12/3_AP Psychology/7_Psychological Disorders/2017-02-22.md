## Treatment of Psychological Disorders

### Trephining
- **Trephining** = the act of deliberately creating a hole in the skull
    * Interestingly, this can be a treatment for a physical malady with the brain
        + *e.g.*
            - Fluid buildup
            - Hematoma
- Has been used since ancient times

### Therapy
- **Psychotherapy** = a method of treatment that involves an interaction between a trained therapist and a person suffering from a psychological disorder
    * So, psychotherapy is basically just any type of therapy for mental illness
        + It is not exclusively psychoanalysis; can be cognitive, behavioral, etc
    * Is often characterized by
        + Heavy emotional weight
        + Complete honesty and confidentiality
    * **Eclectic Approach** = the tactic of applying different therapy methods depending on a person-by-person basis
        * Like someone who uses cognitive psychology, biomedical tactics, and psychoanalysis depending on the circumstances

#### Psychoanalysis
- **Psychoanalysis** = a method of psychotherapy developed by Sigmund Freud that analyses how repressed urges or impulses affect emotions and behaviors
    * Has a theoretical basis in his model of personality
    * Is seldom practiced in its original form today
        + Partially because it takes a much longer time to see results
- The essential aim is to surface unconscious motivations and desires
    * Freud believes that conflicts among the **id**, **ego**, and **superego** can cause anxiety
        + Bringing these conflicts to the conscious awareness can permit the patient to resolve the underlying cause of their problems
- According to Freud, *anxiety* is the chief causes for psychological disorders
    * Anxiety is thought to be created when sexual or aggressive impulses are forcefully repressed
    * Guilt is when those impulses are partially but incompletely expressed
- Modern psychoanalytic techniques are often called "psychodynamic therapy" or "insight therapy"
- **Displacement** = the act of directing impulses towards a less threatening or intimidating entity
- **Projection** = the act of justifying one's conflicts by accusing others of having the same behaviors or conflicts
    * *e.g.* If you feel anxious or guilty about a behavior, you might accuse others of the same behavior in order to make yourself feel better
    * Is often a defense mechanism
- **Resistance** = a kind off barrier that barrs the conscious mind from dealing with certain subjects
    * Thought to be an indication of repressed impulses
- **Transference** = a directing of emotional content or conflicts onto the therapist
- **Interpretation** = the collaborative association of behavioral or cognitive patterns with symbolic meaning

#### Humanistic Therapy
- **Humanistic Therapy** = a model of psychotherapy that emphasizes the fundamentally good nature of humans and the potential for **self-actualization**
    * **Self-actualization** = the state of fulfilling one's potential or resolving an ultimate question
- Is often called **Client-centered therapy**
    * **Client-centered therapy** = a method developed by Carl Rogers and Abraham Maslow
        + Characterized by
            - Active listening
            - Genuine interest
            - Empathy
            - Total acceptance
        + Focuses on facilitating personal growth
    * This is because the therapy is more directed by the patient than the therapist
        + The patient can stop at any time, and the patient decides what to talk about
    * The relationship is more co-equal than in other models of psychotherapy
