##### Why Do Anxiety Disorders Exist?
- **Learning perspective** = anxiety disorders are "learned" from the surroundings as one grows up
    * Explains how phobias can be passed on from parent to child without any genetic component
    * **Fear conditioning** = anxiety disorders arise from associations between harmful stimuli and harmless stimuli
    * **Stimulus generalization** = a phobia developed from conditioning can become broader than the stimuli that first causted it
        + *e.g.* a fear of a white rat can generalize into fear of white, fluffy things
    * **Reinforcement** = an effect of strengthening the association between a harmful stimulus and a harmless one by exerting effort to avoid the causing stimulus
- **Biological perspective** = anxiety disorders can be caused by genetic or physiological factors
    * **Genetic** factors can predispose people to certain phobias
        + Perhaps natural selection is behind some of the most common phobias
    * **Physiology** = anxious symptoms actually manifest in physiological ways
        + Increased heart rate
        + Brain activity
        + Stress hormones
