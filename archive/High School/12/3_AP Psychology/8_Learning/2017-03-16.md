## Cognitive Approach to Learning
- **Latent learning** = a type of learning that isn't conditioned
    * Happens almost by accident
- **Cognitive map** = a mental scheme of a space
    * Studied by E.C. Tolman
- **Overjustification effect** = describes how extrinsic rewards tend to overpower intrinsic rewards
    * For example, if you love playing piano, and then you get a regular paycheck for playing, you motivate yourself with the extrinsic reward
        + Then, if the extrinsic reward is dropped, you have less motivation than you did starting
- **Intrinsic motivation** = the motivation to do something purely because you *enjoy* doing it
    * Generally, this is more *durable* than learned behavior with **extrinsic motivation**
- **Extrinsic motivation** = the motivation to do something purely because you are rewarded or punished if you do do or don't it, respectively
    * Is more prone to "burn-out"
- **Observational learning** = learning by imitation
    * Studied by Albert Bandura
    * **Modeling** = the process of learning a behavior through this means
    * **Prosocial behavior** = constructive, helpful behavior
        * Essentially the opposite of **antisocial behavior**
    * **Mirror neurons** = neurons in the frontal lobe that fire when performing an observed action or observing itself
        + Thought to be an explanation as to why imitation happens
