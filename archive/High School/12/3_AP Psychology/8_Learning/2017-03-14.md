### Positive Reinforcement and Negative Reinforcement
- **Positive reinforcement** = the addition of a pleasing stimulus to reinforce behavior
- **Negative reinforcement** = the removal of an aversive stimulus to reinforce behavior
- Note that negative reinforcement is *not* the same thing as **punishment**
    * **Punishment** = the addition of an aversive stimulus to inhibit a behavior
        + Two types
            1. **Positive punishment** = the addition of an aversive stimulus to reinforce behavior
            2. **Negative punishment** = the removal of a pleasing stimulus to reinforce behavior
        + Punishment is sometimes effective, but not encouraged
            - Does not teach what the *acceptable* pattern of behavior is
            - Can produce hostility, passivity, or fear
            - Not very durable
            - Models aggression

### Primary Reinforcement and Secondary Reinforcement
- **Primary reinforcement** = a form of operant conditioning that uses unlearned stimuli to reinforce behavior
    * *e.g.*
        + Using sugary foods to positively reinforce behavior by adding a pleasing, unlearned response
        + Using a drug to negatively reinforce behavior by removing an aversive, unlearned response
- **Secondary reinforcement** = a form of operant conditioning that uses learned stimuli to reinforce behavior
    * *e.g.*
        + Using the learned desire to accrue wealth to reinforce behavior

### Schedules of Reinforcement
- **Immediate reinforcement** = a type of reinforcement where the duration between action and reinforcing stimulus is short
    * In contrast to **delayed reinforcers**
- **Continuous reinforcement** = a type of reinforcement where the stimulus and desired behavior are always paired
- **Intermittent reinforcement** = a type of reinforcement where the stimulus and desired behavior aren't always paired
    * Makes the process of learning the behavior more difficult
        + But, when it is learned, it is more durable
    * Also called **partial reinforcement**
- Four types of Reinforcement Schedules
    1. **Fixed ratio** = behavior and reinforcement are paired after a predictable amount of actions
        + *e.g.*
            - Tenth car wash is free!
    2. **Variable ratio** = behavior and reinforcement are paired after an unpredictable amount of actions
        + This proves to be the *most* durable form of reinforcement
            - Because the lack of reinforcement is *expected*
        + *e.g.*
            - Gambling
    3. **Fixed interval** = behavior and reinforcement are paried after a predictable amount of time
        + *e.g.*
            - Wage labor
    4. **Variable interval** = behavior and reinforcement are paired after an unpredictable amount of time
        + *e.g.*
            - Weather
            - Pop quizzes
            - DUI checkpoints
