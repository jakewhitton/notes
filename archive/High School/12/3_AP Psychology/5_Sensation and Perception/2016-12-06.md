## Hearing
- **Audition** = the raw experience of hearing
- **Frequency** = number of oscillations of sound wave per second
    * Measured in **Hertz(Hz)**
    * Just like **frequency** in light
- **Pitch** = a tone's character of being high or low
    * Dependent upon frequency
- **Amplitude** = the magnitude of the sound wave
    * Described as the height of the wave crests
- **Decibel system** = a method of ranking sound amplitude
    * Is based on a *logarithmic* scale

### Anatomy of the Ear
- **Outer Ear**
    * **Ear lobe**
    * **Auditory canal**
- **Middle Ear**
    * **Tympanic membrane**
        + Also called **eardrum**
    * Three bones
        + **Malleus(Hammer)**
        + **Incus(Anvil)**
        + **Stapes(Stirrup)**
    * **Semi-circular canals**
        + Also called **vestibular sacs**
- **Inner Ear**
    * **Cochlea**
        + Snail-shaped tube with ciliated **basilar membrane**
            - **Cilia** = cytoplasmic extensions that typically serve in motion but can also sense pressure changes
            - **Basilar membrane** = ciliated lining inside the **cochlea**
        + **Transduction** occurrs here
    * **Auditory nerve**
        + Attached to **cochlea**
