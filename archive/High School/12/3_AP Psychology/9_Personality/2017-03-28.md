### Trait Theory of Personality
- **Trait** = a unique pattern of behavior
    * Associated with Gordon Allport
- **Rayman Cattell** = a psychologist who developed the "16 personality factors"
    * *e.g.*
        + Self Assured vs Apprehensive
        + Undisciplined vs Controlled
- **Hans Eysenck** = psychologist who developed a two-dimensional plane describing personality
    * Two axes
        1. Stable vs Unstable
        2. Introverted vs Extraverted

|             |  Unstable   |   Stable    |
|-------------|-------------|-------------|
| Introverted | Melancholic |  Phlegmatic |
| Extroverted |  Choleric   |   Sanguine  |

- **Personality inventory** = a questionaire meant to assess what traits one has
    * Shortcomings
        + Relies on client honesty
        + Very long tests
            - Can cause fatigue and skew accuracy
        + Sometimes people aren't the best judges of their behavior
    * **Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory(MMPI)** = the most widely researched and used personality inventory
        + Initially developed as a diagnostic tool for emotional disorders
        + Now is used broadly as a screening purpose
            - Like a test you take to make sure you are fit for service, etc
        + 500 true or false questions
- Type A vs Type B
    * **Type A** = a personality category characterized by an intense, focused drive towards achieving goals
        + Heavily oriented around tasks and completing things
    * **Type B** = a personality category characterized by a diminished emphasis on task completion and goal setting
        + More laid back and easy-going

### Five Factor Model of Personality
- Basic principle is that five characteristics are inherited or present at a very young age
1. Openness vs Close-minded
2. Conscientiousness vs Undisciplined
3. Extraversion vs Introversion
4. Agreeable vs Antisocial
5. Neuroticism vs Emotional stability

### Social Cognitive Perspective of Personality
- **Social cognitive theory** = a theory of personality that emphasizes the importance of observational learning and interpersonal effects
- **Reciprocal determinism** = the model of personality that is affected by interactions between behavior, environment, and mental processes
- **Self-efficacy** = one's confidence that they can do the things a situation requires
- **Personal control** = one's confidence that their environment can be changed through action
    * A poor sense of personal control is essentially just hopelessness
- **External locus of control** = the vectors that affect one's environment that cannot be controlled
- **Internal locus of control** = the vectors that affect one's environment that can be controlled through action
- **Learned helplessness** = the effect where one's mental model of internal and external loci of control stay persistent, and one believes they have no control over their situation when they really do
