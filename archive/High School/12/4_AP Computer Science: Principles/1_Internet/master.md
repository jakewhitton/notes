Censorship is typically defined as the holding back of a piece of content.  Censorship can occurr before or after publishing.  I created a google spreadsheet to test whether or not the school district is artificially holding us from seeing certain things.  It is understandable that the district would censor some things--vulgarity or hate speech would be such an example.  However, perfectly normal things are being withheld from the user by the filtering software the school network employs.

As you can see from this spreadsheet, searches with the keyword "communism" get censored at a rate of about 81%.  Searches with the keyword "capitalism" get censored a paltry 0.78% of the time.  Clearly, the capitalist class does not want us to be researching communism using the public infrastructure of the school network.  Censoring is always about pushing an agenda, and this is no different.  For the school to brazenly enforce ideological uniformity is disruptive to the entire goal of education itself.  It needs to be stopped.
