## Unemployment
- **Unemployment rate** = the ratio of the able-bodied population that is looking for a job but hasn't gotten hired yet
$$ \%_{Unemployed} = \frac{Q_{unemployed}}{Q_{labor force}} * 100 $$
- where $Q_{unemployed}$ is the number of unemployed persons in an economy and $Q_{labor force}$ is the number of persons that are in the **labor force**
    * **Labor force** = the part of the population that is considered as employed or potentially employable
        + Must be above 16 years old
        + Able and willing to work
        + Not institutionalized
            - *i.e.* prison, mental hospitals, etc
        + Not serving in military, a full-time student, or retired


### Three Types of Unemployment
1. **Frictional unemployment** = a type of unemployment characterized by apt workers that are between jobs or temporarily unemployed
    * **Seasonal unemployment** = a type of **frictional unemployment** characterized by working periods being *seasonal*
        + *e.g.* a Santa clause impersonator
2. **Structural Unemployment** = a type of unemployment characterized by the skills of the labor force becoming obselete
    * Especially relevant *now*, as automation changes the economic landscape
    * **Creative destruction** = a term that describes the process of these kinds of jobs disappearing
    * **Technological unemployment** = a specific type of **structural unemployment** driven by automation
3. **Cyclical unemployment** = a type of unemployment that is caused by the effects of a recession
    * Due to recssions, consumer demand decreases across the board, and companies respond with a reduced demand for labor
        + Cyclical unemployment is also called "demand deficient unemployment"

### Natural Rate of Unemployment
- **Natural Rate of Unemployment(NRU)** = the rate of unemployment that is deemed "normal" for an economy not in recession
    * Based on frictional and structural unemployment
- **Full employment output(Y)** = the real GDP generated if an economy does not experience cyclical unemployment
    * So, "full employment" is really just an "acceptable" unemployment calculated with frictional and structural unemployment rates
        + For the United States, "full employment" is at ~5% unemployment
