### Example of Calculating Some Values
- Assume year 1 is base year

|  Year  |  Units of Output  |  Price |  Nominal GDP |  Real GDP  |  CPI  |
|--------|-------------------|--------|--------------|------------|-------|
|   1    |       10          |   $4   |     $40      |   $40      |  100  |
|   2    |       10          |   $5   |     $50      |   $40      |  125  |
|   3    |       15          |   $6   |     $90      |   $60      |  150  |
|   4    |       20          |   $8   |     $160     |   $80      |  200  |
|   5    |       25          |   $4   |     $100     |   $100     |  100  |

### CPI vs GDP Deflator
- **GDP deflator** = a metric of of price changes of *all* goods produced
- **CPI** = a metric of price changes for a very specific market basket
- In general, if prices for inputs changes, that will be reflected in GDP deflator
    * So, CPI is an *incomplete* story
