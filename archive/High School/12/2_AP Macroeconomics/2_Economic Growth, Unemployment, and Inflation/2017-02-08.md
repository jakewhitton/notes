### Income Appraoch to Calculating GDP
- The model essentially boils down to 4 **factor payments**
    1. Labor income = essentially just the wages individuals earn
    2. Rental income = the income generated by owning something and renting it out
    3. Interest income = the income generated by interest on loans
    4. Profit = the income generated by exploiting the working class

## Nominal GDP vs Real GDP
- **Inflation** = a rise in costs
- **Nominal GDP** = non-inflation adjusted GDP
    * For example, the nominal GDP-per-capita of the United States in 1970 was 5,246.96 USD-1970
- **Real GDP** = inflation-adjusted GDP
    * This is what's actually used to make comparisons in purchasing power between periods

### Business Cycle
- **Business cycle** = a model of the economy that relates real GDP with time
    * The curve has an overall increasing trend line
        + However, the economy goes through periods of boom and bust
        + Visually, the curve snakes around an "ideal" line of full employment
            - Periods of time where the curve is above the line is **inflation**
            - Periods of time where the curve is below the line is **unemployment**
    * **Recession** = a period of decline in real GDP that lasts for 6 months
        + If significantly longer, it is a **depression**
