## What is Aggregate Demand
- **Aggregate Demand** = a metric of overall demand for *all* goods
    * You can think of it as a **demand schedule** of all the goods and services people are willing to purchase at different price levels
        + The same relation applies
            - Increasing price yields lower quantity demanded
            - Decreasing price yields higher quantity demanded
    * A useful way of looking at it is that aggregate demand is *really* just real GDP
        + This actually makes sense, because it is basically just the market value of all goods at any given time
$$ AD = C + I + G + \Sigma X $$
        + where $C$ is consumer spending, $I$ is investment, $G$ is government spending, and $\Sigma X$ is net exports
- You can construct a demand curve using **price level(PL)** and **Real GDP** just like with price and quantity demanded

### Why is the Aggregate Demand Curve Downward-Sloping?
1. **Wealth Effect** = a change in price level changes the purchasing power of a dollar, and thus the quantity of transactions changes
    * Increasing price yields lower "GDP demanded"
    * Decreasing price yields higher "GDP demanded"
2. **Interest-Rate Effect** = a change in price level changes interest rates that lenders charge
    * If price level increases, the lend is more risky, so a higher interest rate is charged
    * If price level decreases, the lend is less risky, so a lower interest rate can be charged
3. **Foreign Trade Effect** = a change in domestic price level invokes a kind of substitution effect wherein foreign goods are bought more or less
    * If domestic price level increases, GDP demanded(which doesn't include foreign production) will decrease because consumers are purchasing foreign goods
    * If domestic price level decreases, GDP demanded(which includes domestic production) will increase because consumers are purchasing more domestic goods

### Shifters of Aggregate Demand
1. Change in consumer spending
    * Can be caused by many things
        1. Change in disposable income of consumers
        2. Expectations about future economic growth or contraction
            + If people are fearful of a recession, they won't spend as much
        3. Consumer debt
        4. Changes in consumer taxes
2. Change in investment spending
    * Can be caused by many things
        1. Change in interest rates
        2. Expectations about future demand trends
            * If a new industry pops up and shows potential for growth, investment will increase
        3. Changes in labor productivity or automation
            * If productivity(output vs input ratio) increases, companies will invest to take advantage of that
        4. Changes in business taxes
3. Change in government spending
    * Is only caused by a change in government expenditures
        + *e.g.* Buying more drones to bomb Libya with
4. Change in net exports
    * Can be caused by many things
        1. Change in exchange rates
            * If the USD->Euro exchange rate changes, the purchasing power of each respective currency changes, and net exports change
        2. Change in domestic economic well-being
            * Generally, countries with high GDP-per-capita spend more on foreign goods

## Aggregate Supply
- **Aggregate supply** = the quantity of goods and services businesses will produce(Real GDP) at certain price levelsj
    * Has different behaior depending on time interval
        + **Short-run aggregate supply** = input costs(wages, natural resources, etc) do not increase as price level increase
            - If there is a right shift in aggregate demand, businesses can generate more profit, so they scale production
        + **Long-run aggregate supply** = input costs(wages, natural resources, etc) *will* increase as price level increases
            - If there is a right shift in aggregate demand, businesses can scale for more profit, but eventually input costs will rise

### Shifters of Aggregate Supply
1. Change in input costs
    * **Supply shocks** = some event that rapidly affects the availability of some good
2. Change in taxes, regulations, or subsidies
3. Change in productivity

## Inflationary and Recessionary Gaps
- **Inflationary gap** = a situation in which the equillibrium point on the AD-AS graph is to the right of the LRAS line
- **Recessionary gap** = a situation in which the equillibrium point on the AD-AS graph is to the left of the LRAS line
    * Is generally caused by a shift in AD, but can be caused by a shift of AS
    * **Stagflation** = a situation caused by a negative supply shock that stagnates growth and causes inflation
        + Is caused by a leftward shift of aggregate supply

## Aggregate Supply In the Long Run
- Generally, a shift of aggregate demand will correspond with a long-term opposite shift in aggregate supply
    * For example, an increase in AD will result in a higher equillibrium price, and eventually input costs will increase(i.e. wage pressure) causing a decrease in AS
    * If AD decreases, equillibrium price will decrease, so producers will scale their production down
        * With less demand for inputs(labor, resources, etc), their price will go down
            + That decrease in input costs causes an increase in AS
- **Capital stock** = the amount of capital goods purchased or produced by an economy to increase output
    * This is the *only* thing that can shift the LRAS line

### Classical Economics vs Keynesian Economics
- **Classical economics** = a theory of economics developed by Adam Smith and Hayek
    * Basic premise is that AS is always a vertical line
        + In other words, producers are constantly trying to produce at max level
            - Thus, AS is a vertical line determined by labor productivity and resources
    * Touts that government intervention is *inefficient*; that the market will regulate itself
- **Keynesian economics** = a theory of economics developed by Keynes
    * Basic premise is that AS is a horizontal until it meetes with demand, where it starts going up
    * **Sticky wages** = a characteristic of input costs to stay relatively constant
- **Intermediate range** = a section of upward sloping AS curve meant to link the classical and keynesian AS curve

## Phillip's Curve
- **Phillip's curve** = a graph that demonstrates an inverse relationship between inflation and unemplyoment

## Fiscal Policy
- **Car analogy** = a model of the economy that states a car is analogous to the entire economy
    * *You could go really fast, but its not sustainable*
    * *You could go really slow, but you're losing out on potential*
    * *You should go at the "right" speed, because it maximizes growth & production without causing inflation*
    * In this scenario, gas mileage is like the LRAS curve
        + If you improve efficiency or reduce input costs, you can go at a faster speed without reprocussions

### The Role of Consumers
- In this world, your duty is to *consume*
    * "The last remaning American passtime is... BUYING THINGS" --- George Carlin
    * **Autonomous consumption** = a type of consumption that doesn't scale with disposable income
        + *e.g.*
            - Food
            - Gas
            - Clean water
    * **Disposable income** = the level of income that a person has to spend after autonomous consumption
    * **Dissaving** = the effect when incomes are less than that required for autonomous consumption
        + As a result, people are actually *losing* money with time

### Government Action
1. **Fiscal policy** = actions taken by Congress to modulate economic growth or consumption
    * Essentially, Congress can change *spending* or *taxes*
    * **Discretionary Fiscal Policy** = the act of passing a *bill* to enact economic change
        + Takes a hideously long time, due to buraeucratic inefficiency
    * **Non-Discretionary Fiscal Policy** = mechanisms in bills that have already passed that enact economic change
        + Also called **Automatic stabilizers**
        + *e.g.*
            - Welfare = when unemployment rises, welfare programs will provide aid to stimulate consumption
            - Unemployment ensurance = when unemployment rises, unemployment insurance ensures that individuals can still consume
            - Minimum wage = when labor costs dip, minimum wage ensures consumption doesn't fall too low
    * **Contractionary Fiscal Policy** = a form of fiscal policy that increases taxes to inhibit consumption/investment while decreasing government spending
        + Can technically be discretionary or non-discretionary, but is *usually* discretionary
    * **Expansionary Fiscal Policy** = a form of fiscal policy that decreases taxes to increase consumption/investment while increasing government spending
2. **Monetary policy** = actions taken by the Federal Reserve Bank to modulate economic growth or consumption

## Multiplier Effect
- **Multiplier effect** = the tendency for consumption to set off a chain reaction of transactions
    * A buys from B
    * B uses profit to buy from C
    * C uses profit to buy from D
    * D dives into their Scrooge McDuck money pool
- This effect modifies the behavior of government spending
    * If a government increases expenditures by $10 million, the actual increase in aggregate GDP demanded will increase by some multiple of that
        + If money has a high velocity, that money will be used in many transactions---each of which contribute to GDP
        + If people save because of a recession, the velocity of money is decreased
            - Thus, the money the government spends won't spur as much consumption
- Essentially, if I gave you $100, you would likely spend some portion of it and save some portion of it
    * If you are a compulsive consumer, your consumption will spur economic growth
        + CONSUME.  OBEY.
    * **Marginal Propensity to Consume(MPC)** = a metric of the tendency for consumers to increase their consumption with a corresponding increase in income
$$ MPC = \frac{\Delta Consumption}{\Delta Income} $$
    * **Marginal Propensity to Save(MPS)** = a metric of the tendency for consumers to increase their savings with a corresponding increase in income
$$ MPS = \frac{\Delta Savings}{\Delta Income} $$
    * There is a simple equation that relates these two quantities
$$ MPC + MPS = 1 $$
        + This is true because one can only *spend* or *save* any additional income
            - Thus, the fraction of dollars spent and the fraction of dollars saved must add up to 100%

### How is GDP "Multiplied" by Government Spending?
- The formula is actually farely simple
- **Multiplier** = a quantity that measures the degree of increase of GDP that corresponds
$$ Multiplier_{Government\ Spending} = \frac{1}{MPS} $$
- And this is the relation of GDP to multiplier
$$ \Delta GDP = Multiplier \times \Delta (Government\ Spending) $$

### How is GDP "Multiplied" by Taxes?
- There is a multiplier for changes in taxes, but it is less pronounced
    * This is thought to be related to how consumers and businesses react when they hear that taxes will increase or decrease
    * Formula for tax multiplier
$$ Multiplier_{Taxes} = \frac{MPC}{MPS} $$
$$ Multiplier_{Taxes} = \frac{1 - MPS}{MPS} $$
$$ Multiplier_{Taxes} = \frac{1}{MPS} - \frac{MPS}{MPS} $$
$$ Multiplier_{Taxes} = \frac{1}{MPS} - 1 $$
$$ Multiplier_{Taxes} = Multiplier_{Government\ Spending} - 1 $$
- Then,
$$ \Delta GDP = Multiplier_{Taxes} \times \Delta (Tax\ Revenue) $$
