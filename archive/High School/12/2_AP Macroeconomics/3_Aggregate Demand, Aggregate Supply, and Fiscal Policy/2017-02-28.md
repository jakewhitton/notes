    * Has different behaior depending on time interval
        + **Short-run aggregate supply** = input costs(wages, natural resources, etc) do not increase as price level increase
            - If there is a right shift in aggregate demand, businesses can generate more profit, so they scale production
        + **Long-run aggregate supply** = input costs(wages, natural resources, etc) *will* increase as price level increases
            - If there is a right shift in aggregate demand, businesses can scale for more profit, but eventually input costs will rise
