## Inflationary and Recessionary Gaps
- **Inflationary gap** = a situation in which the equillibrium point on the AD-AS graph is to the right of the LRAS line
- **Recessionary gap** = a situation in which the equillibrium point on the AD-AS graph is to the left of the LRAS line
    * Is generally caused by a shift in AD, but can be caused by a shift of AS
    * **Stagflation** = a situation caused by a negative supply shock that stagnates growth and causes inflation
        + Is caused by a leftward shift of aggregate supply
