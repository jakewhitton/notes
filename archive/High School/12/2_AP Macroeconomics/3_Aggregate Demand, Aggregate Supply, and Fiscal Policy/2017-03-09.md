## Multiplier Effect
- **Multiplier effect** = the tendency for consumption to set off a chain reaction of transactions
    * A buys from B
    * B uses profit to buy from C
    * C uses profit to buy from D
    * D dives into their Scrooge McDuck money pool
- This effect modifies the behavior of government spending
    * If a government increases expenditures by $10 million, the actual increase in aggregate GDP demanded will increase by some multiple of that
        + If money has a high velocity, that money will be used in many transactions---each of which contribute to GDP
        + If people save because of a recession, the velocity of money is decreased
            - Thus, the money the government spends won't spur as much consumption
- Essentially, if I gave you $100, you would likely spend some portion of it and save some portion of it
    * If you are a compulsive consumer, your consumption will spur economic growth
        + CONSUME.  OBEY.
    * **Marginal Propensity to Consume(MPC)** = a metric of the tendency for consumers to increase their consumption with a corresponding increase in income
$$ MPC = \frac{\Delta Consumption}{\Delta Income} $$
    * **Marginal Propensity to Save(MPS)** = a metric of the tendency for consumers to increase their savings with a corresponding increase in income
$$ MPS = \frac{\Delta Savings}{\Delta Income} $$
    * There is a simple equation that relates these two quantities
$$ MPC + MPS = 1 $$
        + This is true because one can only *spend* or *save* any additional income
            - Thus, the fraction of dollars spent and the fraction of dollars saved must add up to 100%

### How is GDP "Multiplied" by Government Spending?
- The formula is actually farely simple
- **Multiplier** = a quantity that measures the degree of increase of GDP that corresponds
$$ Multiplier_{Government\ Spending} = \frac{1}{MPS} $$
- And this is the relation of GDP to multiplier
$$ \Delta GDP = Multiplier \times \Delta (Government\ Spending) $$

### How is GDP "Multiplied" by Taxes?
- There is a multiplier for changes in taxes, but it is less pronounced
    * This is thought to be related to how consumers and businesses react when they hear that taxes will increase or decrease
    * Formula for tax multiplier
$$ Multiplier_{Taxes} = \frac{MPC}{MPS} $$
$$ Multiplier_{Taxes} = \frac{1 - MPS}{MPS} $$
$$ Multiplier_{Taxes} = \frac{1}{MPS} - \frac{MPS}{MPS} $$
$$ Multiplier_{Taxes} = \frac{1}{MPS} - 1 $$
$$ Multiplier_{Taxes} = Multiplier_{Government\ Spending} - 1 $$
- Then,
$$ \Delta GDP = Multiplier_{Taxes} \times \Delta (Tax\ Revenue) $$
