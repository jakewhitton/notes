## Fiscal Policy
- **Car analogy** = a model of the economy that states a car is analogous to the entire economy
    * *You could go really fast, but its not sustainable*
    * *You could go really slow, but you're losing out on potential*
    * *You should go at the "right" speed, because it maximizes growth & production without causing inflation*
    * In this scenario, gas mileage is like the LRAS curve
        + If you improve efficiency or reduce input costs, you can go at a faster speed without reprocussions

### The Role of Consumers
- In this world, your duty is to *consume*
    * "The last remaning American passtime is... BUYING THINGS" --- George Carlin
    * **Autonomous consumption** = a type of consumption that doesn't scale with disposable income
        + *e.g.*
            - Food
            - Gas
            - Clean water
    * **Disposable income** = the level of income that a person has to spend after autonomous consumption
    * **Dissaving** = the effect when incomes are less than that required for autonomous consumption
        + As a result, people are actually *losing* money with time

### Government Action
1. **Fiscal policy** = actions taken by Congress to modulate economic growth or consumption
    * Essentially, Congress can change *spending* or *taxes*
    * **Discretionary Fiscal Policy** = the act of passing a *bill* to enact economic change
        + Takes a hideously long time, due to buraeucratic inefficiency
    * **Non-Discretionary Fiscal Policy** = mechanisms in bills that have already passed that enact economic change
        + Also called **Automatic stabilizers**
        + *e.g.*
            - Welfare = when unemployment rises, welfare programs will provide aid to stimulate consumption
            - Unemployment ensurance = when unemployment rises, unemployment insurance ensures that individuals can still consume
            - Minimum wage = when labor costs dip, minimum wage ensures consumption doesn't fall too low
    * **Contractionary Fiscal Policy** = a form of fiscal policy that increases taxes to inhibit consumption/investment while decreasing government spending
        + Can technically be discretionary or non-discretionary, but is *usually* discretionary
    * **Expansionary Fiscal Policy** = a form of fiscal policy that decreases taxes to increase consumption/investment while increasing government spending
2. **Monetary policy** = actions taken by the Federal Reserve Bank to modulate economic growth or consumption
