## Circular Flow
- There are *two* markets
    * **Product Market** = a market where goods and services are sold to consumers
        + Fundamentally for **consumer goods**
    * **Resource/Factor Market** = a market where input and capital is sold to producers
        + Fundamentally for **capital goods**
- Value flows in a circular way to and from different parts of the cycle
    * The government can modulate the process through taxes and subsidies
- **Private Sector** = the subset of the economy that consists of privately owned businesses and individuals
- **Public Sector** = the subset of the economy that consists of public goods and government projects
- **Factor Payments** = payments for capital
    * Roughly synonomous with "costs"
    * *e.g.*
        + Wages
        + Rent
        + Physical capital
        + Interest on loans
- **Transfer Payments** = a government action that redistributes wealth or income
- **Subsidies** = a patronage of a particular business or industry using public tax-dollars
