### How Congress is Organized to Make Policy

    * Established a **bicameral legislature**
        + Composed of *two* houses
            - Senate
            - House of Representatives
    * Federalist Paper 51
        + "in order to control the legislative authority, you must divide it"
- House of Representatives
    * 435 members = assigned to each state based on population
        + Each state gets 1 to start with, even if they don't have that much population
    * 2-year terms in office
        + Constantly re-elected
        + Makes the House the institution of government closest to the people
    * Responsible for all spending/taxing bills = **power**
    * Debate time is limited == **rule**
        + This is because there are 435 PEOPLE
    * General role = regulate spending
- Senate
    * 100 members
        + Each state gets 2 members
