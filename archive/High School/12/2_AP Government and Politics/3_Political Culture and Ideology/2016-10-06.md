# Political Culture and Ideology

### Key Question
- Who are the American people and what do they believe about government and politics?

### The Census
- The constitution mandates a census every decade
- Historians use that data to make judgements about the voting populus
- **Sample** = a collection of participents that represent a certain population
- **Random Sample** = technique employed by statisticians to ensure a sample is representative
    * Every member of a certain demographic should have an equal chance of being the representative of that demographic in the sample
- **Representative Sample** = sample must contain sufficiently large sub-samples for each demographic the survey is targetting
- **Sampling Error** = margin of error in survey results
- **Wording Effect** = wording of poll questions must be unambiguous and unbiased

### Three Waves of Immigration
- Wave 1: Western Europeans
    * Spain, Portugal, Britain, France, etc
- Wave 2: Southeastern European
- Wave 3: Asians and Hispanics
    * Asians come from war-torn areas = refugees
