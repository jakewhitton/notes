### What is Physics?
- **Physics** = the study of physical phenomenon and the mechanisms that cause them
    * This class is focused on **electromagnetism**
- Physics first discovered by the Greek philosophers
    * Rub piece of amber and it "pulls" straw near it
- **Hans Christian Oersted** = physicist who discovered the *unity* of electricity and magnetism(~1820)
    * Prior to this, the two phenomenon were assumed to be independent of one another
- **Michael Faraday** = physicist that pioneered much of the properties of electromagnetism
    * Didn't break these laws down into concrete formulas
        + Physicists *love* them some formulas
- **James Clerk Maxwell** = physicist who made Faraday's discoveries more conrete
    * Created **Maxwell's Equations**
        + **Gauss's Law**
$$ \nabla \cdot \textbf{E} = \frac{\rho}{\epsilon_0} $$
        + **Gauss's Law for Magnetism**
$$ \nabla \cdot \textbf{B} = 0 $$
        + **Faraday's Law of Induction**
$$ \nabla \times \textbf{E} = - \frac{\delta \textbf{B}}{\delta t} $$
        + **Ampere's Circuital Law**
$$ \nabla \times \textbf{B} = \mu_0 \big( \textbf{J} + \epsilon_0 \frac{\delta \textbf{E}}{\delta t} \big) $$
- **Benjamin Franklin** = American scientist
    * Credited with describing the two electric charges as "positive" and "negative"
    * Also introduced the idea of **excess charge**
        + **Excess charge** = an imbalance in positive and negative charge

### Conductors and Insulators
- **Conductor** = a material that permits electrons to move relatively freely
    * **Superconductors** = a material that acts as a *perfect* conductor
        + Offers no resistance to electric flow
    * Generally, conductors have electrons on the outer shells whose ionization energy is small
- **Insulators** = a material that blocks electrons from moving freely
    * Also called **nonconductors**
- **Semiconductor** = a material whose capacity to permit electrons to move freely is in between **insulators** and **conductors**
- **Induced charge** = a phenomenon in which an object's internal electric field will orient itself to align with an external electric field and create a **dipole**
    * **Dipole** = an object that is positively charged on one side and negatively charged on the other

### Coulomb's Law
- **Electrostatic force** = the force that charged particles exert on one another
    * Vector quantity--the direction always points towards or away from the particle in question
- **Coulomb's Law** = an equation that describes the magnitude of the **electrostatic force**
    * Named after Charles-Augustin de Coulomb
    * Discovered in 1785
$$\vec{F} = k \frac{q_1 q_2}{r^2} \hat{r}$$
$$\vec{F} = \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \frac{q_1 q_2}{r^2} \hat{r}$$
$$k = \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} = 9.99 \times 10^9 \frac{N m^2}{C^2}$$
$$\epsilon_0 = 8.85 \times 10^{-12} \frac{C^2}{N m^2}$$
    * $\epsilon_0$ is called the **permittivity constant**
        + Mostly used for historical reasons, as it made simplifying other equations easier
    * Very similar to equation for Newtonian gravity
$$\vec{F_g} = G \frac{m_1 m_2}{r^2} \hat{r}$$

#### Electric Charge and Current
- SI unit for charge is **Coulomb(C)**
    * For practical reasons, the **Coulomb** is defined using the **Ampere**
- **Ampere** = SI unit for current
    * Current is defined as the following, where $i$ is current and $q$ is charge
$$i = \frac{dq}{dt}$$
        + Rearranging, we can see where the units come from
$$i \times dt = dq$$
$$(A) \times (sec) = (C)$$
        + So 1 Ampere is equal to $1 \frac{C}{sec}$, and 1 Coulomb is equal to $1 A \times sec$
- Electrically charged objects(which we treat as particles for simplicity) exhibit many of the same characteristics as do particles in newtonian physics
    * **Force** vectors add together to create a **net force**($\sum \textbf{F}$)
        + **Net force** is also called **resultant force**

### Shell Theories
- **Shell theories** = models that are used to simplify problems by assuming that bodies can be treated as particles
- Shell Theory 1
    * a charged particle placed *outside* of a **shell** that is uniformly charged about its surface will experience an electrostatic force equal to the circumstance in which the shell is a particle located at the center of the shell with the same charge
- Shell Theory 2
    * a charged particle placed *inside* of a shell that is uniformly charged about its surface will experience no electrostatic force from the shell
        + Why would that be the case???
- **Spherical conductors**
    * in a spherical conductor with an excess charge, particles seek to maximize the distance between all other similarly charged particles

## Charge Is Quantized
- Originally, scientists thought that electric charge was a continuous phenomenon
    * But, because matter is a discrete phenomenon, charge is as well
- **Elementary charge** = the essential "stepping size" that the net charge of an object or particle can increment or decrement by
    * *All* charges can be represented as
$$ n \textbf{e} , n \in \mathbb{Z} $$
    * where
$$ \textbf{e} = 1.602 \times 10^{-19} C $$
- **Quantized** = a word that is meant to convey the discrete nature of a phenomenon
    * things come in "packets" rather than continuously flowing like a substance

## Charge Is Conserved
- In physics, almost *everything* is conserved
    * the same holds true for **charge**
- Charge acts like mass in classical Newtonian physics
- **Conservation of Charge** = a hypothesis put forth by Benjamin Franklin that asserts the prior is the case
- Examples
    * Nuclear decay
        + Whenever a decay event occurs, the newly created particles always have an overall charge that is equal to that of the parent particle
            - $^{238}$U $\to$ $^{234}$Th + $^{4}$He
        + **Annihilation** = two particles colliding and destroying each other
            - Charge is perserved
        + **Pair Production** = the spontaneous creation of particles from existing energy
            - $\gamma \to$ e$^{-}$ + e$^{+}$
