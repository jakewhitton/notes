## How Does $\vec{E}$ Relate to Force?
- Imagine we had a point particle of charge $q$
    * If we placed that particle into an $\vec{E}$ field, it would experience an **electrostatic force**
        + The $\vec{E}$ field we place the particle in is often called the **external field**
- Since the unit of our $\vec{E}$ field is $\frac{N}{C}$, we can express the electrostatic force as
$$ \vec{F} = q \vec{E} $$
- Really, this is true just because of the way we defined $\vec{E}$

### Elementary Charge
- **Elementary charge($e$)** = the charge, in $C$, of one proton
    * Or, equivalently, the opposite of the charge of one electron
- The equation
$$ \vec{F} = q \vec{E} $$
- actually helped calculate this value!
- **Millikan Oil-Drop Experiment** = a test that can be used to determine the value of $e$
    1. Arrange a cylinder with two volumes, separated by a flat conductive material with a small hole in the center
        * Label the top volume A
        * Label the bottom volume B
        * Label the conductive separator S
    2. Connect one terminal of a battery to the bottom plate(which is also conductive) and another to a switch
        * Then, connect the other switch terminal to the conductive separator S
    2. Spray oil into A as an aerosol
        * Some particles accumulate a excess charge through collisions
    3. As oil drops occasionally land in C, take measurements as to how long it takes particles to move certain distances
- Through using the above procedure, we can determine how electrostatic forces are affecting the oil particles
    * In addition, if you assume that
$$ q \in \{ n e \}, n \in \mathbb{N} $$
    * then, you can calculate what $e$ actually is!
        + Note that you must first assume charge is quantized before you make this leap

### Ink-Jet Printing
- Interestingly, this relationship between $\vec{F}$ and $\vec{E}$ is used in ink-jet printing technology
    * A voltage is applied across two conductive plates, and the ink particles(which are consistent in charge) are sent through
        + By modulating the voltage, the ink drop can be driven to a specific spot
        + Alternatively, if the voltage is kept constant(as a result, $\vec{E}$ is kept constant), then you can accomplish the same effect by changing $q$

### Electrical Breakdown and Sparks
- If $\vec{E}$ is sufficiently high(it surpasses a value known as $\vec{E}_c$, which stands for $\vec{E}$-critical), electrons in the surrounding material can be stripped
    * The result is that the air becomes conductive because there are so many freed electrons
        + As current passes through this pseudo-conductor, the electrons occasionally strike atoms, causing a release of light
            - This is what causes the "spark" look
