## Civil Liberties

### Key questions:
  1. What is the basis for our liberties?
  2. What are "property rights"?
  3. Do we have a right to "privacy"?

## Practice FRQ

> Initially, the United States did little to protect citizens from the actions of the states.  In the twentieth century, the Supreme Court interpretted the Constitution to protect the rights of citizens from state governments in a process referred to as **selective incorporation**
>   a. Define **selective incorporation**
>   b. For **two** of the following, explain how each has been incorporated.  Each of your explanations must be based on a specific and relevant Supreme Court decision.
>     - Rights of criminal defendants
>     - First Amendment
>     - Privacy rihts

####Answer  
a. Selective incorporation is the process by which the Bill of Rights is selectively applied to the actions of states on a court-by-court basis.
b. 
  - **Rights of criminal defendants**: The bill of rights explicitly grants rights to those accused of crimes.  However, those rights weren't typically applied to the states.  In particular, states were not required to provide suspects with legal representation if they could not afford it.  That changed with *Gideon v Wainwright*, which established the principle that, without ready access to public defenders, the accused could not be guaranteed a fair and speedy trial, violating the Bill of Rights.
