#Civil Rights and Civil Liberties

##Civil Liberties

Key questions:

  1. What is the basis for our liberties?
  2. What are "property rights"?
  3. Do we have a right to "privacy"?

###What is the difference?

Civil Liberties:

  - Specific protections against government tyranny
    * The bill of rights
  - 14th Amendment
    * *Due Process Clause*
      + >"No state shall deprive any person of life, liberty or property without due process of law."
      + Forms the basis of all civil liberties court cases

Civil Rights:

  - Protections against *discrimination*
  - 14th Amendment
    * *Equal Protection Clause*
      + >"No state shall deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws."

###Selective Incorporation
  - The process by which fundamental civil liberties are extended from federal restrictions to include state restrictions
  - *Gitlow v New York(1925)*
    * Supreme court rules that freedom of speech and press apply to states as well
    * Court ruled that it didn't meet "clear and present danger" conditions established in *Schenck v US(1919)*
    * However, BoR application will be decided on a court-by-court basis
