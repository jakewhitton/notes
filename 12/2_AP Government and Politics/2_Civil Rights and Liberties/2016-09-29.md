            + Composed of many people suing simultaneously but given the alias *Brown v Board of Education* for simplicity

        * "Seperate but equal is *inherently* unequal"
        * No real legal basis for decision--based upon social science and the like
    - Court case was initially spotty in its enforcement
        * Linda Brown wants a federal enforcement order

        * Also called "affirmative action"
        * *University of California Regents v Bakke(1978)*
        * *Gratz v Bollinger(2003)*
