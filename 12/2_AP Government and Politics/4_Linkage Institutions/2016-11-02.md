### Running for President
- **Presidential Primary** = election through which candidates for president are selected
    * **Caucus** = people gather in a room and vote with their feet, each candidate has a chance to convince the others
        + Like how Mongol societies voted with horse
        + Iowa is first caucus
    * **Primary** = simple ballot casting procedure that selects a candidate using the FPTP system
    * Criticism
        + Early caucuses and primaries get more attention
        + Later states are discouraged from participating if not a close race
        + **Frontloading** = state holds a primary or caucus early to get all that *sweet*, *sweet* media attention
- **National Party Convention** = delegates allocated during primary season meet to vote for who the party's official candidate will be
    * Usually, primary winner is already known due to vote count
        + Doesn't stop media from making damned good use of all that footage of balloons falling
    * Serves to unite the party after a bitter primary season
    * Isn't as big a deal as it used to be
    * **McGovern Fraser Commission(1968)** = commitee that wrote new set of rules for selecting delegates in the Democratic convention
        + Aimed at increasing representation for women and minorities
    * **Superdelegates** = delegates that are typically pledged to one candidate before primary season even begins
        + Serves the interest of the party
- **General Election** = actual election season between the major parties
    * Debates are held to give candidates opportunities to voice policy
    * Media speculation can sway voter turnout
    * **Electoral College** = system by which the general election happens
        + Each state legislature gets assigned a limited number of **electors**
            - State legislatures fill those spaces with people they like
        + Candidate who reaches **plurality** takes all of the electors for that state
            - **Plurality** = more than anyone else
            - This doesn't apply to Nebraska and Maine; they assign electors proportionally
        + Serves as insulating layer between the government and the people
        + Shifts focus towards "battle-ground" states and highly-populated states
