### Running for President
- **Presidential Primary** = election through which candidates for president are selected
    * **Caucus** = people gather in a room and vote with their feet, each candidate has a chance to convince the others
        + Like how Mongol societies voted with horse
        + Iowa is first caucus
    * **Primary** = simple ballot casting procedure that selects a candidate using the FPTP system
    * Criticism
        + Early caucuses and primaries get more attention
        + Later states are discouraged from participating if not a close race
        + **Frontloading** = state holds a primary or caucus early to get all that *sweet*, *sweet* media attention
- **National Party Convention** = delegates allocated during primary season meet to vote for who the party's official candidate will be
    * Usually, primary winner is already known due to vote count
        + Doesn't stop media from making damned good use of all that footage of balloons falling
    * Serves to unite the party after a bitter primary season
