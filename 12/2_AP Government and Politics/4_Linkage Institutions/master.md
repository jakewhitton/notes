    * Little to no media involvement in politics
- Franklin Delano Roosevelt(1933-1945)
    * Modern media becomes intertwined with politics

        + Morale booster
        + Sympathizes with issues Americans face

    * Wategate scandal lampoons Nixon
    * Vietnam war creates sense of disallusionment with government
    * **Investigative journalism** = The use of in-depth study of a case to reveal the details of a particular subject

### Media Coverage
- Media holds a lot of leverage in what gets airtime
- ↑Coverage = ↑Public engagement
- Can also affect tone
- **Policy Agenda** = the collection of issues the media brings into focus that the government can address
    * "spin" = a unique framing of a problem that leads people towards a certain view
    * **Political Capital** = reputation among other politicians and the public that can be expended for policy
        + Almost like a currency

#### Practice FRQ
> One of the most important ways the news media influence politics is through agenda setting.
>
> - a. Define policy agenda
> - b. Explain how the national news media engage in agenda setting
> - c. Explain the primary reason the president tends to have an advantage over Congress in gaining media attention

##### Answer
- a. **Policy agenda** is the collection of issues the media chooses to focus on through selective airing and tone.
- b. Media sources only have a limited amount of time they can expect their audience to consume their media.  Through selectively choosing to give airtime to certain issues and putting a "spin" on their presentation, they can develop the issues that are prevalent in the common consciousness.
- c. Electoral elections get much higher voter turnout than do congressional elections; more people pay attention to the president.  Additionally, the president is easier to tie into a narrative; individual intentions become clearer when they are directed by a single person as opposed to a body of elected officials.

### Bias in the Media
- Two types of bias
    * **Ideological bias** = some media outlets exhibit a right-left lean
        + CNN(Clinton News Network)
        + Fox News
    * **Structural bias** = stories are chosen and presented in orer to get good ratings--not necessarily to present the truth
        + "If it bleeds, it leads."

### Running for President
- **Presidential Primary** = election through which candidates for president are selected
    * **Caucus** = people gather in a room and vote with their feet, each candidate has a chance to convince the others
        + Like how Mongol societies voted with horse
        + Iowa is first caucus
    * **Primary** = simple ballot casting procedure that selects a candidate using the FPTP system
    * Criticism
        + Early caucuses and primaries get more attention
        + Later states are discouraged from participating if not a close race
        + **Frontloading** = state holds a primary or caucus early to get all that *sweet*, *sweet* media attention
- **National Party Convention** = delegates allocated during primary season meet to vote for who the party's official candidate will be
    * Usually, primary winner is already known due to vote count
        + Doesn't stop media from making damned good use of all that footage of balloons falling
    * Serves to unite the party after a bitter primary season
    * Isn't as big a deal as it used to be
    * **McGovern Fraser Commission(1968)** = commitee that wrote new set of rules for selecting delegates in the Democratic convention

    * Debates are held to give candidates opportunities to voice policy
    * Media speculation can sway voter turnout
    * **Electoral College** = system by which the general election happens
        + Each state legislature gets assigned a limited number of **electors**
            - State legislatures fill those spaces with people they like
        + Candidate who reaches **plurality** takes all of the electors for that state
            - **Plurality** = more than anyone else
            - This doesn't apply to Nebraska and Maine; they assign electors proportionally
        + Serves as insulating layer between the government and the people
        + Shifts focus towards "battle-ground" states and highly-populated states
