### Media Coverage
- Media holds a lot of leverage in what gets airtime
- ↑Coverage = ↑Public engagement
- Can also affect tone
- **Policy Agenda** = the collection of issues the media brings into focus that the government can address
    * "spin" = a unique framing of a problem that leads people towards a certain view
    * **Political Capital** = reputation among other politicians and the public that can be expended for policy
        + Almost like a currency

#### Practice FRQ
> One of the most important ways the news media influence politics is through agenda setting.
> - a. Define policy agenda
> - b. Explain how the national news media engage in agenda setting
> - c. Explain the primary reason the president tends to have an advantage over Congress in gaining media attention

##### Answer
- a. **Policy agenda** is the collection of issues the media chooses to focus on through selective airing and tone.
- b. Media sources only have a limited amount of time they can expect their audience to consume their media.  Through selectively choosing to give airtime to certain issues and putting a "spin" on their presentation, they can develop the issues that are prevalent in the common consciousness.
- c. Electoral elections get much higher voter turnout than do congressional elections; more people pay attention to the president.  Additionally, the president is easier to tie into a narrative; individual intentions become clearer when they are directed by a single person as opposed to a body of elected officials.

### Bias in the Media
- Two types of bias
    * **Ideological bias** = some media outlets exhibit a right-left lean
        + CNN(Clinton News Network)
        + Fox News
    * **Structural bias** = stories are chosen and presented in orer to get good ratings--not necessarily to present the truth
        + "If it bleeds, it leads."

        + Means they write legislation for broad purposes

### Negative Perception of Interest Groups
- Generally, interest groups are seen as a negative influence on politics
- *Why?*
