### What Makes an Interest Group Successful?
- **Free-Rider Problem** = people can benefit from activities of interest groups without supporting them
    * Unions face a similar problem with collective bargaining
    * The larger the group, the more significant this problem is
- Group Size
    * Smaller groups are easier to manage than large groups
    * Larger groups offer faster spread of information
        + *Propaganda*
    * **Consumer Advocacy Group** = an interest group composed of consumers that aims to shape policy that benefits said consumers
    * **Selective Benefits** = only giving certain benefits to members of the interest groups
        + Helps to curb the Free-Rider Problem
- Intensity
    * **Single-Issue Groups** = interest groups that organize behind one particular stance on one particular issue
        + Members can focus on their *unity*, rather than their differences
    * Emotionally charged subjects tend to unite like-minded people
        + Psychological advantage
    * More likely to act directly
        + Protests
        + Petitions
- Financial Backing
    * We live in a capitalist dystopia
    * If you want to reach people, you'll need money
        + Results in corporate speech being heard much more loudly than individual speech

### How Do Interest Groups Shape Policy?
- **Lobbying** = the process of hiring a person to go to Congress and affect policy-making
    * Lobbyists provide information to Congresspeople
    * Allows politicians to take credit for advancing that policy position
- **Electioneering** = direct influence on electoral process
    * **Political Action Committee(PAC)** = organizations funded by corporations and unions that donate to candidates directly
        + 527's and 501(c)3's are used to file donations as **independent expenditures**
            - **Independent Expenditure** = an expense that is eligible for write-off
            - Makes rich people's incomes *look* smaller(less tax), while being able to influence the political process
