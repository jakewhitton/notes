### Practice FRQ
> American politics has been  called an "invitation to struggle."  Although in recent years the president has been thought to have an advantage in policy-making, there are still constraints on the power of the president.
>
> a. Describe a power of the president in each of the following roles
>     - Chief legislator
>     - Chief bureaucrat or chief administrator

#### Answer
- **Vetoing a bill**:  If a bill passes through Congress, the president can move to veto said bill.  This amounts to barr the bill from being signed into law, effectively killing the bill unless Congress can override with a supermajority.
- **Appointing to the Bureaucracy**:  The president has the power to appoint certain people to different positions as the head of certain bureaucratic agencies.  For example, President Obama made Hillary Clinton, who lost in the Democratic primary to Obama, as Secretary of State.  This power allows the president to excercise power as Chief Administrator by choosing *who* to appoint to said positions.


### Inside the White House
- The **Vice President** actually has very few Constitutional duties
    * As a result, the **President** typically appoints the **Vice President** to an important cabinet position
    * VP's function to **balance the ticket**
        + **Balance the ticket** = make the campaign more widely supported by packing a *more* appealing VP to win more states
- **Cabinet** = body composed of advisors to the President
    * Members serve as Secretaries of various Federal Departments
        + Does count as a federal appointment--must be approved by Senate
- **Executive Office** = a body of members that do **not** belong to the bureaucracy
    * Has the role of **briefing** the president of information
        + Said info is received from collaboration between the **Cabinet** and the **Executive Office**
    * Because they are not federal appointments, they are **not** confirmed by the Senate
    * *Four* main associations
        + **National Security Council(NSC)**
        + **Council of Economic Advisors(CEA)**
        + **Office of Management and Budget(OMB)**
        + **White House Office** = a body composed of staff and chief aides
            - Typically chosen on basis of loyalty
            - **Because** they are members of the executive office, they do **not** need to be appointed by the Senate
- **First Lady** = the romantic partner of the President
    * No official constitutional role
    * Typically run initiatives that focus on single issues
        + Michelle Obama = childhood obesity
        + Hillary Clinton = healthcare

### The Dynamics of Shared Power
- The **president** and **Congress** need to cooperate in order for policy-making to happen
- **Checks and Balances**
    * **Veto** = the power to reject a bill that has been passed by Congress
        + Can be bypassed by a **two-thirds majority** of **both** houses
    * **Pocket Veto** = the power to refrain from signing a bill without actually vetoing it
        + The bill silently expires after 10 days
        + **Cannot** be overturned--effectively kills a bill
    * **Line Item Veto** = the power to veto **parts** of a bill
        + The president *used* to have this power, but it was overturned by the **Supreme Court**
        + State governors **do** have this power
