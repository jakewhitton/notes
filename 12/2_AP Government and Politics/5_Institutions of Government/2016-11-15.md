### Dynamics of Power in Congress
- House of Representatives
    * **Speaker of the House** = official elected by House
        + Exercises significant control over comittee assignments and legislation
        + Serves as coordinator for debate time and committee action
    * **Whips** = party affiliates who exert influence over politicians by threatening to withdraw support of the party to their candidacy
    * House Committee Rules
        + **Closed Rule** = bill cannot be modified on the floor
            - Must be passed *as-is*
        + **Open Rule** = bills can be modified on the floor
            - Easier to get passed
            - Possible that bill's purpose will be compromised into nonexistence
- Senate
    * **Vice President** = official that oversees the Senate
    * **President Pro-Tempore** = An official, typically a Senator, that the Senate elects to be a "backup" president in case the President and Vice President die
        + Typically the senior member of the majority party
    * Each party's senators elects a leader
        + Majority party's leader effectively controls the Senate because he can influence the majority of the delegates
        + Minority party's leader is essentially powerless
    * **Filibuster** = unlimited debate time
        + Introduced in the 1830's
    * **Cloture** = a vote that moves to end debate on a topic
        + Requires a super-majority(60%)

### Congressional Committees
- **Congressional Committees** = collection of Congresspeople that principally focus on a few issues
    * **Chairman** = leader of committee
    * Central role: consider and develop legislation
    * **Standing Committee** = a permanent committee
        + Allocated one subject on which to consider policy
        + Constitutes the source of most bills
    * **Select/Special Committee** = short-term committee meant to address a pressing issue
        + Traditionally functions as an investigative body
        + **Oversight Hearings** = individuals associated with the federal bureaucracy testify to things that are investigated by certain Congressional committees
    * **Joint Committee** = a committee composed of members from both chambers of Congress that are meant to serve interests of Congress as a whole
