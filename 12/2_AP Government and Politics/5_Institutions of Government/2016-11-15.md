### Dynamics of Power in Congress
- House of Representatives
    * **Speaker of the House** = official elected by House
        + Exercises significant control over comittee assignments and legislation
        + Serves as coordinator for debate time and committee action
    * **Whips** = party affiliates who exert influence over politicians by threatening to withdraw support of the party to their candidacy
    * House Committee Rules
        + **Closed Rule** = bill cannot be modified on the floor
            - Must be passed *as-is*
        + **Open Rule** = bills can be modified on the floor
            - Easier to get passed
            - Possible that bill's purpose will be compromised into nonexistence
- Senate
    * **Vice President** = official that oversees the Senate
    * **President Pro-Tempore**
    * Each party's senators elects a leader
        + Majority party's leader effectively controls the Senate because he can influence the majority of the delegates
        + Minority party's leader is essentially powerless
    * **Filibuster** = unlimited debate time
        + Introduced in the 1830's
    * **Cloture** = a vote that moves to end debate on a topic
        + Requires a super-majority(60%)

### Congressional Committees
- **Oversight Hearings** = individuals associated with the federal bureaucracy testify to things that are investigated by certain Congressional committees
