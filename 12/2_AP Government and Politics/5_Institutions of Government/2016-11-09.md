#Institutions of Government

## Congress
- **Constituents** = the group of people being represented by a Congressperson
- Office Requirements
    * House of Reps
        + At least 25 years old
        + Citizen for at least 7 years
    * Senate
        + At least 30 years old
        + Citizen for at least 9 years
- Election cycles
    * House of Reps
        + Popularly elected every two years
    * Senate
        + Initially, elected by state legislatures every 6 years
            - Due to 17th Amendment, senators are now popularly elected

### Districts
- For the assignment of representatives, **districts** are drawn
    * **District** = a section of the state in question
    * The candidate with the plurality in that district wins the seat
    * If a state has *x* representatives, they draw *x* districts
- **Redistricting** = the process of state legislatures re-drawing district boundaries
    * Meant to be a mechanism through which the electoral process keeps up to date with a changing population
    * Happens when a new census is done
    * Results in **Gerrymandering** = the drawing of districts to benefit one party
        + Cram as many of the opposing party into a few, concentrated districts
        + Let the rest of the districts be a narrow but predictable victory for your party

### Incumbency
- **Incumbency** = the state of seeking re-election
- After cold war, there is a large increase in "career politicians"
    * People are seeking stability and level-headedness
- Advantage in advertising and visibility
- **Franking Privileges** = ability to use existing infrastructure to communicate with constituents at no cost
    * Primarily mail system = they can send postage for free
        + FREE ADVERTISING
- **Gerrymandering** = technically illegal, but is still done
    * As a result, only about 25% of seats were *truly* competitive
- **Credit Claiming**
    * **Casework** = individual help provided to constituents
    * **Pork Barrel** = projects or grants that specifically benefit certain districts/states
        + Tangible things: roads, bridges, highways, hospitals, schools, etc
    * **Earmark** = extra provisions baked into a bill that benefit a certain group of constituents
        + Like the "add your pork" instruction on the Mock bill assignment
        + Less tangible
- **Position Taking** = the act of portraying one's self as hardworking, principled individuals
    * Can be easier to back up if you have a good voting record
- Much of the time, opponents to incumbents are poorly funded and disorganized in comparison
- *Why do incumbents ever lose?*
    * Scandals
    * Gerrymandering puts them at a disadvantage
    * Anti-government sentiment
