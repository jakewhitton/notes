### Administrative Discretion
- The **bureaucracy** has the ability to selectively enforce policy
- A lot of power is placed in the hands of bureaucrats
- Often, policy is implemented across several agencies
    * Called **fragmentation**
    * Requires the collaboration of many agencies to effectively block the execution of a certain policy

### Why Do Some Policies Fail and Some Succeed?
- Reasons for failure
    1. Poor program design
    2. Lack of resources
    3. Ill-defined goal
        - Congress typically defines laws really vaguely
- Reasons for success
    1. Clear stated goal
    2. Was implemented in a non-objectionable way

### Regulation vs Deregulation
- **Regulation** = the excercising of control over some industry by passing legislation
    * Based on **incentives** and **disincentives**
    * Examples of **incentives**
        + Tax credits
        + Deductions
    * Examples of **disincentives**
        + Tax penalties
        + Fees
- **Deregulation** = the elimination of existing regulations
    * Pioneered by **Ronald Reagan**
    * Can place American producers at a disadvantage
        + Free trade policy allows greater mobility of jobs while mobility of labor is relatively constant

### Does the Bureaucracy Work?
- The bureaucracy is often bolstered with good intention but executed poorly
- Often, placing bureaucratic responsibilities on common people introduces security risks
    * Russian spies are going to steal all of our secrets
        + Like who's getting a driver's license and when
- Bureaucracy can be very sluggish
    * Hurricane Katrina is a good example
- **Writs of Certiorari** = a writ that allows a case to be handed off to a superior court at their discretion
    * Meant for very rare use
