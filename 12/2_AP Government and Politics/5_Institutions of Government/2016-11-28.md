## The President

### Big Ideas
- What is the *structure* of the presidency?
- Executive branch is the one that runs the government


### Structure of the Executive
- **Act with Dispatch**
    * Described in federalist paper #70
- Founded on principle of **separation of powers**
- **Formal** requirements for office
    * Must be 35 years or older
    * Must have resided in US for at least 14 years
        + Serves to protect country for foreign interests
    * Must be a natural-born citizen
- **Informal** requirements
    * Must be white
        + Obama is currently the only exception
    * Must be male
        + Hillary Clinton got fairly far, but we still haven't had a female president or president-elect
    * Must be Christian
        + Almost always Protestant, except JFK, who was Catholic
- Typically, the Presidency is occupied by someone who hold former office in a governmental role


### Structure of the "Term"
- Terms are defined as to last for 4 years
- **22nd Amendment** = Presidents are limited to two terms
    * Pushed through because FDR served for... like... infinity

### Succession and Impeachment
- If the President dies, the Vice President will succeed him/her
- If the Vice President then dies, the Speaker of the House will succeed him/her
- **Impeachment** = the drawing of charges against an official for violating the law
- **Trying** = the ruling of guilt or innocence of said official
- Only two presidents have been impeached
    * Andrew Johnson
    * William Clinton
    * Richard Nixon was **NOT** impeached; he resigned before they could impeach him
