### Approval Rates
- **Approval ratings** = rates of favorable views held on president
    * Mostly a result of extraneous factors that are out of the president's control
        * *eg.* George Bush Sr. benefits from economic explosion following the collapse of the Soviet Union
- Higher approval ratings gives the president more leverage over influencing legislative process
- Initially, approval rates are fairly high
    * *Why?*
        + Incumbents feel *familiar*
        + Washington outsiders feel *new*
        + Change still seems possible
        + **"Honeymoon" period** = sh bb I love u
- The role of the media
    * **Horserace Journalism** = focusing on approval ratings and polls rather than the content of policy
    * **Agenda-Setting** = can help modulate peoples' perspectives on the president

### The President and National Security Policy
- **Chief Diplomat** = the role the president fills when he/she advances foreign policy
    * Negotiate treaties
        + Must be ratified by Senate--president doesn't have **complete** control
    * Signing executive agreements
        + An example of an "informal" power of the president
    * Negotiating peace
    * Advocating for US allies abroad
- **Commander in Chief** = the role the president fills when he/she manages the military
    * The framers intended that the president would be a "civilian"
        + Ensures that the president is acting in the US's interests
        + Part of the rationale for granting the president the role of **Commander in Chief**
    * The president can dispatch troops without Congressional consent
- **War Powers Resolution** = an attempt to allieviate the tension between Congress and the President with regards to war
    * Central conflict = Congress can declare war without the president sending troops, and vice versa
    * Provisions
        + The president **must** consult with Congress before sending troops when possible
        + Congress **must** approve the continued stay of troops after 30 days
    * Most presidents have casually ignored it
    * Supreme court side-stepped it with the **political questions doctrine**
        + **Political questions doctrine** = the belief that certain issues belong to the domain of *politics*, rather than to the domain of constitutional law

### The Job of the President
- **Crisis manager** = the role the president fills when he/she serves as a consoling and managerial voice during the aftermath of a crisis
    * Has the potential to massively hurt or massively help approval ratings
    * Congress generally moves much slower than the president
        + Largely because Congress is a body of 535 senators and representatives, whereas the president is one rich white dude
- **Working with Congress**
    * Framers intended president to be sole agent of foreign policy
    * Political gridlock can severely damage approval ratings
- **Working with the Press**
    * The media and the president are often adversaries
    * Media focuses on the **personality** of the president rather than the **content** of his/her policy
