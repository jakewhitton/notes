    * **District** = a section of the state in question
    * The candidate with the plurality in that district wins the seat
    * If a state has *x* representatives, they draw *x* districts
- **Redistricting** = the process of state legislatures re-drawing district boundaries
    * Meant to be a mechanism through which the electoral process keeps up to date with a changing population
    * Happens when a new census is done
    * Results in **Gerrymandering** = the drawing of districts to benefit one party
        + Cram as many of the opposing party into a few, concentrated districts
        + Let the rest of the districts be a narrow but predictable victory for your party

### Incumbency
