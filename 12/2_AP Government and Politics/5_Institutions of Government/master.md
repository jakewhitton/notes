    * If a state has *x* representatives, they draw *x* districts
- **Redistricting** = the process of state legislatures re-drawing district boundaries
    * Meant to be a mechanism through which the electoral process keeps up to date with a changing population
    * Happens when a new census is done
    * Results in **Gerrymandering** = the drawing of districts to benefit one party
