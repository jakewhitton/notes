# Drafting the Constitution

## The Philadelphia Convention
- 55 representatives
- 12 of the 13 states(Rhode Island was missing)
- Largely rich white males who graduated college and had political experience
- Primarily represented coastal cities--not indicative of rural America

### Philosophical Underpinnings:
- Human nature is inherently corrupt and selfish(Locke)
- Political disagreement -> Factions/Political parties
    * Faction = a group of people who organize behind a specific sets of beliefs(Political Parties, Student-Body, etc)
    * Special interest groups are similar to factions, but generally don't offer own political candidates(NRA, etc)
- Government role is to protect property rights(largely self-interested)
- **Seperation of Powers(Montesquieu)** -- ensures federalism will stay

## Make-up of Congress
- Senate = equal representation for each state(New Jersey Plan)
    * Initially, all senators are elected by state legislatures(made democratic by 17th amendment)
    * Primary job is foreign relations
- Approves federal appointments(Supreme court justices, ambassadors, etc)
- Ratifies treaties
- House of Reps = respresentation based on population(Virginia Plan)
    * Directly elected from the beginning every two years; seen as more democratic
    * Primary job is regulating spending and taxes
    * 435 Representatives(always)
- Great Compromise = incorporating both plans into one **bicameral** congress.

## Compromises of the Constitution
- Three-Fifths Compromise
    * Any non-free person counts as 3/5 of a person when determining representation and taxation
- **Voting Requirements left to states**
    * Allowed west to win immigrants, because they allowed broader sufferage

## Economic Issues
- Articles of Confederation made economy weak
    * States could enforce tariffs on goods from other states(no free-trade within US)
    * 14 distinct currencies for each territory -> Rampant inflation, weak international commerce
    * Congress couldn't make states raise taxes
