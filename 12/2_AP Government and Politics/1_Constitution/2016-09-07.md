##National Budget and Its Role in Increasing Federal Gov

Federal Gov can give grants to states
    - Goals:  
        * Have equitable distrobution of resources among the states  
        * Quickly respond to national problems  

**Fiscal Federalism** = the use of grants as leverage in the negotiations between state and federal spheres of power
    - **Conditions of Aid** = demands the federal gov makes in order for states to receive funding
        * STATES; raise the drinking age or no funding for highways!
    - **Mandates** = legislation that forces states to have certain spending programs
        * Can be used to gain power over states
        * An *unfunded* mandate is a mandate that doesn't go with a grant; the states must fund the venture themselves

Grants
    - Categorical Grants
        * Sums of money for very specific purposes defined by the federal government
        * **Project Grants** = *competition* between the states to get federal money
        * **Formula Grants** = money assigned based on a mathematical basis
            + % poverty, uninsured, etc
            + Targets very specific demographic
    - Block Grants
        * Sums of money given to states to do with as they please(broad, non-specific regulation)
        * Actively giving more power to states
        * Pioneered by Reagan
        * **Revenue Sharing** = does not require states to match funds in order to receive grants
