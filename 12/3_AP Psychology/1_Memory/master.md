#Memory and Encoding

Automatic processing:
  - details encoded on:
    * space
    * time
    * frequency
  - practice can reinforce pattern searching abilities(ie reading backward is unconscious processing but needs practice)
    * brain maKes effort to regulate abnormalities
Effortful processing
  - requires selective attention
Ebbinghaus
  - researcher that studied memory
  - Discovered the Spacing Effect
    * depreciate pracTice over many sessions results in better encoding of memories
    * a, ab, abc, abcd -- new sessions cover previous sessions material
    * also called "chaining"
Serial Position Effect
  - tendency to remember first and last members in a list easier
Semantic encoding
  - association between words and meaning
  - crucial to language learning
Acoustic encoding
  - attachment of sound data to a memory
  - Especially pronounced in words and pronounciation
Visual encoding
  - association of visual imagery with a memory
  - Combined with semantic processing, very useful
  - Used commonly with effortful processing
mnemonics
  - Shrink down long sequences into distinguishing characters and string them together into short words or sentences


##Automatic Processing

Viral behavior = behavior that spreads quickly because others mimick behavior they see around them

Method of Loci
  - associate motion through familiar scenes with pieces of information
  - Used in ancient Greece to remember lengthy speeches

Peg Word System
  - Associate a meoldy with a piece of information
  - Very pertinent in advertising

Chunking
  - Grouping bits of information into more manageable units that can be memorized as one
  - Used for numbers often

Iconic Memory
  - Sensory memory associated with visual imagery
  - Used when you suddenly open your eyes and close them and see an afterimage

Echoic Memory
  - Sensory memory associated with sounds
  - lasts ~2sec

Long Term Memory:
  - **Karl Lashley**
    * Worked on rats and long-term memory in 1950
    * Lesion cortex
    * Developed idea of memory trace or _engram_
  - Synaptic Changes
    * Makes neurons more easily activated after brief rapid stimulation
  - Emotional content helps long-term memories form

Explicit Memory/Declarative Memory:
  - Memory of information one can consciously retrieve
  - Stored in hippocampus(in limbic system)

Implicit Memory/Procedural Memory:
  - Memory of information that happens spontaneously


Amnesia = severe memory loss
  - Retrograde amnesia = loss of past memories
    * Associated with head injury
  - Anterograde amnesia = loss of ability to form new memories
    * Associated with damage to the hippocampus

Priming
  - Associated with William James
  - Activation of a memory or association due to sense experience

_Deja Vu_
  - French word for "already seen"
  - Priming may subconsciously activate memories of a similar experience

Mood-Congruent Memory
  - A tendency for memory recall of memories with a similar emotional mood to be easier or more frequent
  - Caused by priming caused by emotional cues

State-dependent Memory
  - Similar phenomenon to Mood-Congruent memory

##Forgetting

The Forgetting Curve
  - Hermann Ebbinghaus
    * Guy with the nonsense sylables
  - 20 minutes after test, 40% gone
  - After that, slow degredation

_Presque Vu_
  - "Tip of the Tongue"
  - Sensation of knowing the information is in the long-term memory, but cannot recall

Interference with Retrieval
  - Proactive Interference
    * Old information supercedes new information
  - Retroactive Interference
    * New information supercedes new information


##Memory construction

Misinformation Effect:
  - filling in gaps with wrong information
    * Information often biased
  - Intentional?

Source Amnesia
  - Also called "misattribution"
  - Mistaking the source of a piece of information--you imagine it came from another person

Loftus Experiment
  - Wording Effect: wording a piece of information in a certain way can change the perception of the information
  - Experiment
    * Two groups: control and experimental
    * Experimental asked how fast two cars where going when they smashed/flew into each other
      + Negative words
    * Control group asked same question with neutral words

Memories of Abuse
  - Can be repressed or even constructed
  - Some genuinely forget

False Memory Syndrome
  - A false memory forms the central part of someone's identity
  - Can happen by therapist's trusting their clients who tell of trauma

Theories of how Forgetting Happens:
  - Failure to encode information
  - Interference by other memories
  - Conscious forgetting
  - Decay of connections

Improving Memory
  - Retrieval cue frequency
  - Consciously rehearse memories shortly after they occurr, so misinformation doesn't tamper with your retrieval
  - Minimize interference
