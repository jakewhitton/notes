#Memory and Encoding

Automatic processing:
	-details encoded on:
		-space
		-time
		-frequency
	-practice can reinforce pattern searching abilities(ie reading backward is unconscious processing but needs practice)
		-brain makes effort to regulate abnormalities
Effortful processing
	-requires selective attention
Ebbinghaus
	-researcher that studied memory
	-Discovered the Spacing Effect
		-depreciate practice over many sessions results in better encoding of memories
		-a, ab, abc, abcd -- new sessions cover previous sessions material
		-also called "chaining"
Serial Position Effect
	-tendency to remember first and last members in a list easier
Semantic encoding
	-association between words and meaning
	-crucial to language learning
Acoustic encoding
	-attachment of sound data to a memory
	-Especially pronounced in words and pronounciation
Visual encoding
	-association of visual imagery with a memory
	-Combined with semantic processing, very useful
	-Used commonly with effortful processing
Mnemonics
	-Shrink down long sequences into distinguishing characters and string them together into short words or sentences
