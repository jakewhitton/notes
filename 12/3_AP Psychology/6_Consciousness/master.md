# Consciousness

### What is Consciousness?
- Damn, that's a complicated question
- **Conscinousness** = a living thing's capacity to know of things happening outside and inside of the *self*
    * What is *self*?
- **Subconsciousness** = a level of awareness that is not available to the conscious mind
    * Contains thoughts and feelings and ideas *just* like the conscious mind
    * Can be seen, but rather elusively
- **Unconscious** = a region of thought that cannot be known by the conscious mind
    * Ambitions and desires
    * Freud said that it also held unresolved conflicts
        + Dreams can be indicative of what is happening in the unconscious

#### Fantasy-prone Personality
- **Fantasy-prone Personality** = a personality type that lends it self to fantasizing in excess
    * Can generate vivid imagery on the fly
    * Frequency of fantasy is drastically higher

#### Biological Clocks
- **Biological clock** = an internal mechanism that directs body systems on their own cycle
- **Entrainment** = a method of training biological clocks to a different rhythym
- **Circadian Rhythym** = a biological clock that regulates desire to sleep
    * Cycle is generally around 25 hours
        + Not congruent with 24-hour light/dark cycle
    * Through **entrainment**, the body can gradually adopt a 24-hour schedule
    * Highs and lows
        + Most people feel most tired between 3:00AM and 5:00AM
        + Most people feel most awake between 3:00PM and 5:00PM
        + Generally based on blood pressure, body temperature, and fatigue

### Sleep and Dreams
- **Rapid Eye Movement(REM) Sleep** = a stage of the sleep cycle that is characterized by darting, random eye movements
    * Typicall happens several times throughout the night
    * Dreams are generally most vivid in this period
    * **Sleep paralysis**
        + Also called "paradoxical sleep"
        + When falling asleep, a hormone is released to inhibit motor neurons from allowing the brain to move body parts
- **Sleep** = a behavior where organisms lose consciousness at the behest of certain brain systems

#### REM vs NREM
| REM SLEEP                                                          | NREM SLEEP                                        |
|--------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| Rapid eye movement                                                 | Non-rapid eye movement                            |
| Grow in duration with sleep duration                               | Grow in duration with sleep duration              |
| Vivid dreams                                                       | Vague, dull dreams                                |
| Nightmares                                                         | Incubus attacks(night terrors)                    |
| Sleep paralysis                                                    | Sleepwalking & talking in sleep                   |
| Essential for body function                                        | Not as essential for body function                |

#### Brain Waves and Sleep
- Different types of brain waves = acronym -- **BAD**
    * **Beta** = brain activity indicative of fully awake people
    * **Alpha** = brain activity indicative of relaxed but awake brain
        + Slower, less erratic
    * **Delta** = brain activity indicative of deep sleep
        + Slower, longer pulses of activity
- **Hallucinations** = false sensory experiences
- **Sleep Spindles** = small bursts of brain activity
    * Occurs in **stage 2** of the sleep cycle
    * Grow in magnitude with duration of sleep
