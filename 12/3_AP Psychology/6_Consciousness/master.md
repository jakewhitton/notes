# Consciousness

### What is Consciousness?
- Damn, that's a complicated question
- **Conscinousness** = a living thing's capacity to know of things happening outside and inside of the *self*
    * What is *self*?
- **Subconsciousness** = a level of awareness that is not available to the conscious mind
    * Contains thoughts and feelings and ideas *just* like the conscious mind
    * Can be seen, but rather elusively
- **Unconscious** = a region of thought that cannot be known by the conscious mind
    * Ambitions and desires
    * Freud said that it also held unresolved conflicts
        + Dreams can be indicative of what is happening in the unconscious

#### Fantasy-prone Personality
- **Fantasy-prone Personality** = a personality type that lends it self to fantasizing in excess
    * Can generate vivid imagery on the fly
    * Frequency of fantasy is drastically higher

#### Biological Clocks
- **Biological clock** = an internal mechanism that directs body systems on their own cycle
- **Entrainment** = a method of training biological clocks to a different rhythym
- **Circadian Rhythym** = a biological clock that regulates desire to sleep
    * Cycle is generally around 25 hours
        + Not congruent with 24-hour light/dark cycle
    * Through **entrainment**, the body can gradually adopt a 24-hour schedule
    * Highs and lows
        + Most people feel most tired between 3:00AM and 5:00AM
        + Most people feel most awake between 3:00PM and 5:00PM
        + Generally based on blood pressure, body temperature, and fatigue

### Sleep and Dreams
- **Rapid Eye Movement(REM) Sleep** = a stage of the sleep cycle that is characterized by darting, random eye movements
    * Typicall happens several times throughout the night
    * Dreams are generally most vivid in this period
    * **Sleep paralysis**
        + Also called "paradoxical sleep"
        + When falling asleep, a hormone is released to inhibit motor neurons from allowing the brain to move body parts
- **Sleep** = a behavior where organisms lose consciousness at the behest of certain brain systems

#### REM vs NREM
| REM SLEEP                                                          | NREM SLEEP                                        |
|--------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| Rapid eye movement                                                 | Non-rapid eye movement                            |
| Grow in duration with sleep duration                               | Grow in duration with sleep duration              |
| Vivid dreams                                                       | Vague, dull dreams                                |
| Nightmares                                                         | Incubus attacks(night terrors)                    |
| Sleep paralysis                                                    | Sleepwalking & talking in sleep                   |
| Essential for body function                                        | Not as essential for body function                |

#### Brain Waves and Sleep
- Different types of brain waves = acronym -- **BAD**
    * **Beta** = brain activity indicative of fully awake people
    * **Alpha** = brain activity indicative of relaxed but awake brain
        + Slower, less erratic
    * **Delta** = brain activity indicative of deep sleep
        + Slower, longer pulses of activity
- **Hallucinations** = false sensory experiences
- **Sleep Spindles** = small bursts of brain activity
    * Occurs in **stage 2** of the sleep cycle
    * Grow in magnitude with duration of sleep

### Sleep Cycle
- **Sleep cycle** = a biological cycle that regulates sleep
    * Duration is typically around 90min
        + Most people go through the cycle at least 4 times
- Order of cycle
    * NREM
        1. Awake
            + Beta waves
        2. Stage 1(Alpha waves)
        3. Stage 3(Sleep spindles)
            + Also contains what used to be called "Stage 4"
                - Delta waves
    * REM
        + Duration of REM periods increase with sleep duration

### Why Do We Sleep?
- **Restoration theory** = theory that posits that sleep serves as a time for the body to restore body strength and condition
- **Adaptive theory** = theory that posits that natural selection caused the emergence of sleep because it preserves energy when there is little danger
- Real danger can come from lack of sleep
    * Symptoms
        + Fatigue
        + Inability to concentrate
        + Lower-performing immune system
        + Greater accident frequency

#### Sleep Drive
- **Sleep drive** = an individuals regular desire and need to sleep
- **Nonsomniacs** = people that have a much lower sleep drive and don't feel tired
- **Insomniacs** = people that have a desire to sleep but can't
- **Narcolepsy** = a condition in which people can almost instantly fall asleep
    * Sometimes dangerous if you're standing or doing some important activity(*ie* driving)
- **Sleep Apnea** = a condition in which breathing patterns are irregular during sleep

### Sleeping Disorders
- **REM Sleep Disorder** = a condition in which sleep paralysis doesn't properly engage
    * People act out their dreams physically
- **Night Terrors** = a condition in which sleep is interrupted often because of feelings of intense fear
    * Physiology actually changes
        + Rapid heart rate
        + Perspiration
    * Typically involves movement and verbalizing too
- **Nightmares** = a vivid dream that invokes anxiety or fear
    * Different from **night terrors**, which involve motion and verbalizing
- **Somnambulism** = a condition in which people get out of bed and walk around
    * Also called "sleepwalking"
    * Typically happens to 25% of people

### Dreams and Psychoanalysis
- Dreams typically involve everyday events
    * But also convey ideas about fear and insecurity
- **Sigmund Freud** = an important psychologist that established **psychoanalysis**
    * Published *The Interpretation of Dreams* in 1900
        + Posited that dreams involve deep wishes and coping with emotions
    * **Manifest content** = the narrative events that underpin a dream
    * **Latent content** = the symbolic meaning that the **manifest content** is meant to encode

###  Purpose of Dreams
- In REM sleep, the brain sorts through information
    * Things that are learned through the day are reinforced
        + One reason why the sleep deprivation in students is bad
- REM sleep periods become longer when one is sleep deprived
- Three hypotheses about the purpose of dreams
    1. Dreaming is a maintenance time for the brain to replenish neurotransmitters and other substances and process information
    2. Dreaming is a time for the brain to work out solutions to problems faced in the days
    3. Dreaming is an attempt to organize information faced in the day into a coherent narrative
        * Almost like a computer defragmentating a spinning hard drive
            + SSD master race

### Hypnosis
- **Hypnosis** = a state of intense relaxation where attention is directed on very particular things
    * Psychologists believe its power is related to the power of *suggestion* to direct focus in certain way
    * **Trances** = periods of time that the subject focuses on becoming more relaxed
        + *Go down, down into the rabit hole*
    * **Posthypnotic amnesia** = thought to be the inability to retrieve memories of what occurred during hypnosis
    * **Orne & Evans** = a group of researchers that studied hypnotic states in 1965
        + Control group was to "pretend" to be hypnotized
        + Experimental group received actual hypnosis
        + Result: no substantial difference
    * **Posthypnotic suggestion** = something that a hypno-therapist embeds in the subconscious to be done after the hypnotic state ends

#### Two Theories of Hypnosis
- **Divided Consciousness Theory** = a theory that explains hypnotic behavior as a split in what different conscious elements of the brain are doing at any given time
    * If things are happening in parallel, the idea is that not all sensations will get through to the conscious mind
    * **Hidden observer** = a kind of third person perspective that subjects take on when hypnotized
        + Can explain how subjects don't feel pain

### Drugs
- Important question: is the drug an **agonist** or **antagonist**?
    * **Agonist** = a substance that imitates a neurotransmitter and falsely activates sreceptors
    * **Antagonist** = a substance that interferes with a particular neurotransmitter--often by blocking the receptor from being activated
- **Tolerance** = a propensity to obtain decreased response to a recurring stimulus or substance
- Four types of drug
    1. **Depressants** = a class of drugs that lowers inhibitions and limits long-distance neural communication
        * Essential, all signals have a hard time getting around

### Hallucinagens
**Hallucinagens** = a class of drugs that alters peception in some noticable way
    + Perhaps the most notable example is **LSD**
        -  Lysergic Acid Di-ethylamide### How Can Hypnosis Help?
- Pain management
    * Childbirth
    * Dentist work
    * Arthritis
    * Back pain
    * Substitute for pain meds
        + *e.g.* morphine
