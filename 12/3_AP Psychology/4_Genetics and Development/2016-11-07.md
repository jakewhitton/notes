##Infancy and Childhood

### Physical Maturation
- Physical Maturation = biological processes that develop the organ systems of a baby and increase its size
    * Mostly controlled by *nature*, **not** nurture
        + Unles the baby is deprived of a nutrients
    * **Developmental Norms** = a set of milestones with expected timestamps meant to help track progress of physical maturation
        + Helps to spot problems early so they can be treated

### Cognitive Maturation
- Cognitive Development
    * **Infantile Amnesia** = mechanism through which memories of the very earliest memories are not encoded
        + Thought to be caused by a lack of neural networks used in memory encoding
    * **Cognition** = all mental processes related to thinking, knowing, remembering, and communicating
    * **Schema** = a model stripped of specificity that objects of perception can be categorized as
    * **Assimilation** = explaining perception in terms of developed schemas
    * **Accomodation** = encountering objects that cannot be categorized and generating new schemas

#### Jean Piaget
- Developed **cognitive development personality theory**
    * 4 states of cognitive development
        + **Sensorimotor**
            - **Egocentrism** = the inability to view things from a perspective other than their own
            - **Object Permanence** = the understanding that things continue to exist even if they aren't visible
            - **Stranger Anxiety** = fear of unknown people, starts at 8 months
            - **Conservation** = the understanding that aspects of matter like mass or volume are conserved regardless of shape
        + **Preoperational**
        + **Concrete Operational**
        + **Formal Operational*
