- Life span segmented into 8 stages
    * Each segment characterized by a different drive and crisis

### Carol Gilligan's Ideas About Gender
- Believes that males and females differ fundamentally in the way they relate to larger groups
- Males = more focused on perceiving themselves as individuals
- Females = more focused on drawing connections between things

### Independence
- The process of social development results, at least in Western cultures, with the individual beginning to separate from the parents
- Increase in arguments
- **Empty-Nest Syndrome**

## Physical Development
- **Menopause** = process by which menstruation stops occurring
    * Women are no longer fertile = cannot become pregnant
- **Alzheimer's Disease** = a slow-developing and irreversible brain disorder
    * Gradual deterioration of cognitive skills
        + Memory
        + Reasoning
        + Language
        + Physical functions
            - Ultimately results in death
    * Difficult to detect, because cognition naturally decays with age

## Cognitive Development
- **Crystallized Intelligence** = accumulated information and encoded memory
    * Tends to increase with age and experience
- **Fluid Intelligence** = ability to reason quickly and in the abstract
    * Tends to decrease with age
