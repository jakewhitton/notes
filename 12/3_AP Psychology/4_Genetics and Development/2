# Genetics
- **Chromosome** = a bundle of DNA and histones that form a condensed structure in the nucleus
    * Some people experience an irregular number of chromosomes
    * **Trisomy** = three chromosomes in a pair
    * **Monosomy** = only one chromosome in a pair
    * Irregularities usually happen in sex chromosomes(23^rd pair)
    * **Turner's Syndrome** = monosomy 23; *only* one X as 23^rd pair
    * **Down Syndrome** = trisomy 21
- **DNA(Deoxyribonucleic acid)** = long strand of nucleotide bases that serves to encode hereditary information
    * **Duble Helix** = geometric shape of DNA; described as a ladder that is twisted
- **Histone** = a protein that DNA can wrap around to reduce overall volume
- **Codon** = a group of three nucleotide bases that match with tRNA to assemble proteins
    * 1 codon corresponds to 1 amino acid instruction(INSERT, START, END, etc)
- **Genotype** = the genes you have
- **Phenotype** = the physical traits you exibit
