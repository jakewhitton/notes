### Social Development

#### Attachment
- **Attachment** = an emotional connection with another person
    * Coined by Mary Ainsworth
    * Young children try to be close to caregiver
        + Similarily, they show anxiety when separated
- **Separation Anxiety** = distress resulting from separation from an attached person
    * Especially seen in infants
    * In healthy infants, as long as the parents are in the vicinity, they feel comfortable to engage in risky behavior
        + Called **secure attachment**
    * In unhealthy infants, they won't feel comfortable unless parent is very near
        + Called **insecure attachment**
        - **Avoidantly Attached** = child avoids parent and is fearful
        - **Anxious Resistant Attachment** = child doesn't avoid parent but isn't comfortable around them
- **Basic Trust** = a feeling that the world is predictable and understandable
    * Coined by Erik Erikson
    * Thought to be formed during infancy
        + Responsive caregivers
        + Loving parents
- **Self-Concept** = an understanding of one's traits and worth to others

#### Harow's Surrogate Mother Experiments
- **Contact comfort** = a feeling induced by touching caregiver
- Monkeys, even when hungry, preferred the contact comfort of a cloth doll to a sustaining wire mother

#### Early Life
- **Critical Period** = a segment of time in which exposure to certain stimuli result in essential cognitive and physical development
- **Imprinting** = the rapid attachment to those first exposed to
    * Sometimes happens immediately after birth

#### Methods of Child Rearing
- **Authoritarian** = relies on the assumption that rules will be followed without question
    * "Why?  Because I said so."
- **Permissive** = gives leeway to child and buys into their desires--few demands and little punishment
- **Authoritative** = a combination of "demanding" and "responsive"
    * Establishes rules, but willing to justify themselves without demanding unconditional obedience
    * Seen in psychological community as the *best* parenting style
- **Rejecting-Neglecting** = disinvestment in the child
    * Little attention is payed to child
    * Can result in abandonment issues

#### Adolescence
- **Adolescence** = transition period between childhood and adulthood
- Lasts from **puberty** to socioeconomic independence
- **Puberty** = biological process of sexual and mental maturation
    * When people become capable of reproduction
- **Primary Sex Characteristics** = physical traits that are necessary to reproduction
    * Primarily genetalia
    * **Menarche** = first menstrual period
- **Secondary Sex Characteristics** = physical traits that serve as identifiers for their gender
    * Males

    * Females
        + Fat redistribution to breasts and hips
    * Both
