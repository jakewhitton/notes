# Genetics
- **Chromosome** = a bundle of DNA and histones that form a condensed structure in the nucleus
    * Some people experience an irregular number of chromosomes
    * **Trisomy** = three chromosomes in a pair
    * **Monosomy** = only one chromosome in a pair
    * Irregularities usually happen in sex chromosomes(23^rd pair)
    * **Turner's Syndrome** = monosomy 23; *only* one X as 23^rd pair
    * **Down Syndrome** = trisomy 21
- **DNA(Deoxyribonucleic acid)** = long strand of nucleotide bases that serves to encode hereditary information
    * **Duble Helix** = geometric shape of DNA; described as a ladder that is twisted
- **Histone** = a protein that DNA can wrap around to reduce overall volume
- **Codon** = a group of three nucleotide bases that match with tRNA to assemble proteins
    * 1 codon corresponds to 1 amino acid instruction(INSERT, START, END, etc)
- **Allele** = a specific version of a gene
- **Genotype** = the collection of alleles one posesses
- **Phenotype** = the physical traits you exibit
- **Dominant Allele** = an allele whose expression takes precedence over that of **recessive** alleles
- **Recessive Allele** = an allele whose expression is inhibited by the presence of a **dominant** allele

### Sex-Linked Traits
- **Sex-Linked Traits** = phenotypes involved with the X or Y chromosomes
- typically *recessive* and located on X chromosome
    * Y chromosome actually contains very few genes
- Examples
    * Color blindness
    * Baldness
    * Hemophilia

##Evolutionary Psychology
- **Natural Selection** = a mechanism set forth by Darwin that describes how genetic information can spread through a population if it confers a survival benefit
- **Mutation** = errors in the genetic code
    * Can be caused by faulty replication
- **Evolutionary Psychology** = the study of behavior and mental processes using natural selection as an explanatory mechanism

### Nature vs Nurture
- *Is our behaior more a product of our **genetics** or of our **environment**?*
- **Identical Twins** = two organisms that developed from the same embryo
    * also called **Monozygotic twins**
- **Fraternal Twins** = two organisms that developed from different fertilized embryos but gestated in same womb
    * also called **Dizygotic twins**
- **Separated Twins** = identical twins that are separated at birth
    * Useful for studying influence of environment
- **Adoption Studies** = studies of different children who are raised as if genetically related
    * Useful for studying influence of genetics

- **Culture** = a group of societal expectations and conventions that influence how we think
- **Norm** = a cultural expectation that is hard to break
    * Similar to a **taboo**
- **Personal Space** = a "buffer-zone" that is expected between people while interacting
- **Memes** = units of culture that can spread among the population simliar to genes
    * **Dank Meme** = a zesty meme that is masterfully crafted

### Prenatal Development
- **Developmental Psychology** = the branch of psychology that focuses on the emergence of physical, cognitive, and social capabilities
    * Characterized by multiple **stages**
- **Embryonic Development**
    * **Fertilization** = sperm cell enters egg and merges genetic information
    * **Zygote** = fertilized egg
        + Rapidly "cleaves" or divides for a period of about two weeks
        + Eventually turns into an **embryo**
    * **Embryo** = stage after zygote but before **fetus**
        + Lasts from second week to about second month
    * **Fetus** = organism that develops into a human
        + Lasts from second month until birth
    * **Teratogens** = any substance that can harm the developing offspring in the womb

            - Symptoms include mis-sized head or death

#### Infant Behavior
- **Infant Reflexes** = behaviors hard-coded into the infant's brain
    * Rooting = turns mouth towards anything that touches their face
    * Grasping = fingers will curl around an object placed in their hand
    * Stepping = legs will take steps instinctually if held up
    * Sucking = will place any object near face into their mouth
    * Startle(Moro) = throws arms out, arches back, and grabs onto something
    * Babinski = curls toes when feet are tickled

#### Sensory Development

##Infancy and Childhood

### Physical Maturation
- Physical Maturation = biological processes that develop the organ systems of a baby and increase its size
    * Mostly controlled by *nature*, **not** nurture
        + Unles the baby is deprived of a nutrients
    * **Developmental Norms** = a set of milestones with expected timestamps meant to help track progress of physical maturation
        + Helps to spot problems early so they can be treated

### Cognitive Maturation
- Cognitive Development
    * **Infantile Amnesia** = mechanism through which memories of the very earliest memories are not encoded
        + Thought to be caused by a lack of neural networks used in memory encoding
    * **Cognition** = all mental processes related to thinking, knowing, remembering, and communicating
    * **Schema** = a model stripped of specificity that objects of perception can be categorized as
    * **Assimilation** = explaining perception in terms of developed schemas
    * **Accomodation** = encountering objects that cannot be categorized and generating new schemas

#### Jean Piaget

### Social Development

#### Attachment
- **Attachment** = an emotional connection with another person
    * Coined by Mary Ainsworth
    * Young children try to be close to caregiver
        + Similarily, they show anxiety when separated
- **Separation Anxiety** = distress resulting from separation from an attached person
    * Especially seen in infants
    * In healthy infants, as long as the parents are in the vicinity, they feel comfortable to engage in risky behavior
        + Called **secure attachment**
    * In unhealthy infants, they won't feel comfortable unless parent is very near
        + Called **insecure attachment**
        - **Avoidantly Attached** = child avoids parent and is fearful
        - **Anxious Resistant Attachment** = child doesn't avoid parent but isn't comfortable around them
- **Basic Trust** = a feeling that the world is predictable and understandable
    * Coined by Erik Erikson
    * Thought to be formed during infancy
        + Responsive caregivers
        + Loving parents
- **Self-Concept** = an understanding of one's traits and worth to others

#### Harow's Surrogate Mother Experiments
- **Contact comfort** = a feeling induced by touching caregiver
- Monkeys, even when hungry, preferred the contact comfort of a cloth doll to a sustaining wire mother

#### Early Life
- **Critical Period** = a segment of time in which exposure to certain stimuli result in essential cognitive and physical development
- **Imprinting** = the rapid attachment to those first exposed to
    * Sometimes happens immediately after birth

#### Methods of Child Rearing
- **Authoritarian** = relies on the assumption that rules will be followed without question
    * "Why?  Because I said so."
- **Permissive** = gives leeway to child and buys into their desires--few demands and little punishment
- **Authoritative** = a combination of "demanding" and "responsive"
    * Establishes rules, but willing to justify themselves without demanding unconditional obedience
    * Seen in psychological community as the *best* parenting style
- **Rejecting-Neglecting** = disinvestment in the child
    * Little attention is payed to child
    * Can result in abandonment issues

#### Adolescence
- **Adolescence** = transition period between childhood and adulthood
- Lasts from **puberty** to socioeconomic independence
- **Puberty** = biological process of sexual and mental maturation
    * When people become capable of reproduction
- **Primary Sex Characteristics** = physical traits that are necessary to reproduction
    * Primarily genetalia
    * **Menarche** = first menstrual period
- **Secondary Sex Characteristics** = physical traits that serve as identifiers for their gender
    * Males
        + Body hair
        + Deepening voices
    * Females
        + Fat redistribution to breasts and hips
    * Both
        + Pubic hair
- Self-Esteem and Maturation
    * Boys feel more comfortable wtih their bodies if they mature early
    * Girls feel less comfortable with their bodies if they mature early

#### Kohlberg's Theory of Moral Development
1. Punishment and obedience orientation
    - Responding to punishment
2. Naive hedonism
    - Doing things for rewards or favors
3. Good boy/girl mentality
    - Doeing things because of approval by peers and parents
4. Acceptance of Norms
    - Accepts laws and conventions for what they are: does not question them
5. Seeking Peaceful Change
    - Coninues to obey law; works to change the law within the confines of the law
6. Self-Actualization
    - Change requires that you disobey the law

### Erikson's Theory of Social Development
- Based in premise that Natural Selection bred into us the propensity to develop relationships that are beneficial to survival
- Life span segmented into 8 stages
    * Each segment characterized by a different drive and crisis

##### The Eight Stages
|   |          Crisis Name           | Basic Virtue |       Age Range        |
|---|--------------------------------|--------------|------------------------|
| 1 |       Trust vs Mistrust        |     Hope     |     Infancy(0-1.5)     |
| 2 |       Autonomy vs Shame        |     Will     | Early Childhood(1.5-3) |
| 3 |      Initiative vs Guilt       |   Puropose   |      Play Age(3-5)     |
| 4 |    Industry vs Inferiority     |  Competency  |     School Age(5-12)   |
| 5 | Ego identity vs Role Confusion |   Fidelity   |    Adolescence(12-18)  |
| 6 |      Intimacy vs Isolation     |     Love     |    Young Adult(18-40)  |
| 7 |   Generativity vs Stagnation   |     Care     |     Adulthood(40-65)   |
| 8 |    Ego Integrity vs Despair    |    Wisdom    |      Maturity(65+)     |

### Carol Gilligan's Ideas About Gender
- Believes that males and females differ fundamentally in the way they relate to larger groups
- Males = more focused on perceiving themselves as individuals
- Females = more focused on drawing connections between things

### Independence
- The process of social development results, at least in Western cultures, with the individual beginning to separate from the parents
- Increase in arguments
- **Empty-Nest Syndrome**

## Physical Development
- **Menopause** = process by which menstruation stops occurring
    * Women are no longer fertile = cannot become pregnant
- **Alzheimer's Disease** = a slow-developing and irreversible brain disorder
    * Gradual deterioration of cognitive skills
        + Memory
        + Reasoning
        + Language
        + Physical functions
            - Ultimately results in death
    * Difficult to detect, because cognition naturally decays with age

## Cognitive Development
- **Crystallized Intelligence** = accumulated information and encoded memory
    * Tends to increase with age and experience
- **Fluid Intelligence** = ability to reason quickly and in the abstract
    * Tends to decrease with age

### Kubler-Ross's Stages of Dying
- A series of steps that occur as one comes to term with the fact that they will die soon
- Stages
    1. Denial
    2. Anger
    3. Bargaining with God
        + What if you're not religious?
    4. Depression
    5. Acceptance of Death
