# Genetics
- **Chromosome** = a bundle of DNA and histones that form a condensed structure in the nucleus
    * Some people experience an irregular number of chromosomes
    * **Trisomy** = three chromosomes in a pair
    * **Monosomy** = only one chromosome in a pair
    * Irregularities usually happen in sex chromosomes(23^rd pair)
    * **Turner's Syndrome** = monosomy 23; *only* one X as 23^rd pair
    * **Down Syndrome** = trisomy 21
- **DNA(Deoxyribonucleic acid)** = long strand of nucleotide bases that serves to encode hereditary information
    * **Duble Helix** = geometric shape of DNA; described as a ladder that is twisted
- **Histone** = a protein that DNA can wrap around to reduce overall volume
- **Codon** = a group of three nucleotide bases that match with tRNA to assemble proteins
    * 1 codon corresponds to 1 amino acid instruction(INSERT, START, END, etc)
- **Allele** = a specific version of a gene
- **Genotype** = the collection of alleles one posesses
- **Phenotype** = the physical traits you exibit
- **Dominant Allele** = an allele whose expression takes precedence over that of **recessive** alleles
- **Recessive Allele** = an allele whose expression is inhibited by the presence of a **dominant** allele

### Sex-Linked Traits
- **Sex-Linked Traits** = phenotypes involved with the X or Y chromosomes
- typically *recessive* and located on X chromosome
    * Y chromosome actually contains very few genes
- Examples
    * Color blindness
    * Baldness
    * Hemophilia

##Evolutionary Psychology
- **Natural Selection** = a mechanism set forth by Darwin that describes how genetic information can spread through a population if it confers a survival benefit
- **Mutation** = errors in the genetic code
    * Can be caused by faulty replication
- **Evolutionary Psychology** = the study of behavior and mental processes using natural selection as an explanatory mechanism

### Nature vs Nurture
- *Is our behaior more a product of our **genetics** or of our **environment**?*
- **Identical Twins** = two organisms that developed from the same embryo
    * also called **Monozygotic twins**
- **Fraternal Twins** = two organisms that developed from different fertilized embryos but gestated in same womb
    * also called **Dizygotic twins**
- **Separated Twins** = identical twins that are separated at birth
    * Useful for studying influence of environment
- **Adoption Studies** = studies of different children who are raised as if genetically related
    * Useful for studying influence of genetics

### Behavior Genetics
- **Behavior Genetics** = a term that describes behaviors that are influenced by genetics
- **Temperament** = a unique set of traits about reaction and emotional intensity
- **Heritability** = the proportion of phenotypic variation that can be attributed to genetics

### Environmental Influences
- **Culture** = a group of societal expectations and conventions that influence how we think
- **Norm** = a cultural expectation that is hard to break
    * Similar to a **taboo**
- **Personal Space** = a "buffer-zone" that is expected between people while interacting
- **Memes** = units of culture that can spread among the population simliar to genes
    * **Dank Meme** = a zesty meme that is masterfully crafted
- Styles of child-rearing
    * Western parents tend to emphasize *independence*
        + Results in teenagers hating their adolescence
            - I wish I was dead
    * Non-Western parents tend to emphasize *interdependence*
        + Stronger sense of "family" or "community"
