# Genetics
- **Chromosome** = a bundle of DNA and histones that form a condensed structure in the nucleus
    * Some people experience an irregular number of chromosomes
    * **Trisomy** = three chromosomes in a pair
    * **Monosomy** = only one chromosome in a pair
    * Irregularities usually happen in sex chromosomes(23^rd pair)
    * **Turner's Syndrome** = monosomy 23; *only* one X as 23^rd pair
    * **Down Syndrome** = trisomy 21
- **DNA(Deoxyribonucleic acid)** = long strand of nucleotide bases that serves to encode hereditary information
    * **Duble Helix** = geometric shape of DNA; described as a ladder that is twisted
- **Histone** = a protein that DNA can wrap around to reduce overall volume
- **Codon** = a group of three nucleotide bases that match with tRNA to assemble proteins
    * 1 codon corresponds to 1 amino acid instruction(INSERT, START, END, etc)
- **Allele** = a specific version of a gene
- **Genotype** = the collection of alleles one posesses
- **Phenotype** = the physical traits you exibit
- **Dominant Allele** = an allele whose expression takes precedence over that of **recessive** alleles
- **Recessive Allele** = an allele whose expression is inhibited by the presence of a **dominant** allele

### Sex-Linked Traits
- **Sex-Linked Traits** = phenotypes involved with the X or Y chromosomes
- typically *recessive* and located on X chromosome
    * Y chromosome actually contains very few genes
- Examples
    * Color blindness
    * Baldness
    * Hemophilia

##Evolutionary Psychology
- **Natural Selection** = a mechanism set forth by Darwin that describes how genetic information can spread through a population if it confers a survival benefit
- **Mutation** = errors in the genetic code
    * Can be caused by faulty replication
- **Evolutionary Psychology** = the study of behavior and mental processes using natural selection as an explanatory mechanism

### Nature vs Nurture
- *Is our behaior more a product of our **genetics** or of our **environment**?*
- **Identical Twins** = two organisms that developed from the same embryo
    * also called **Monozygotic twins**
- **Fraternal Twins** = two organisms that developed from different fertilized embryos but gestated in same womb
    * also called **Dizygotic twins**
- **Separated Twins** = identical twins that are separated at birth
    * Useful for studying influence of environment
- **Adoption Studies** = studies of different children who are raised as if genetically related
    * Useful for studying influence of genetics

### Behavior Genetics
- **Behavior Genetics** = a term that describes behaviors that are influenced by genetics
- **Temperament** = a unique set of traits about reaction and emotional intensity
- **Heritability** = the proportion of phenotypic variation that can be attributed to genetics

### Environmental Influences
- **Culture** = a group of societal expectations and conventions that influence how we think
- **Norm** = a cultural expectation that is hard to break
    * Similar to a **taboo**
- **Personal Space** = a "buffer-zone" that is expected between people while interacting
- **Memes** = units of culture that can spread among the population simliar to genes
    * **Dank Meme** = a zesty meme that is masterfully crafted
- Styles of child-rearing
    * Western parents tend to emphasize *independence*
        + Results in teenagers hating their adolescence
            - I wish I was dead
    * Non-Western parents tend to emphasize *interdependence*
        + Stronger sense of "family" or "community"

### Prenatal Development
- **Developmental Psychology** = the branch of psychology that focuses on the emergence of physical, cognitive, and social capabilities
    * Characterized by multiple **stages**
- **Embryonic Development**
    * **Fertilization** = sperm cell enters egg and merges genetic information
    * **Zygote** = fertilized egg
        + Rapidly "cleaves" or divides for a period of about two weeks
        + Eventually turns into an **embryo**
    * **Embryo** = stage after zygote but before **fetus**
        + Lasts from second week to about second month
    * **Fetus** = organism that develops into a human
        + Lasts from second month until birth
    * **Teratogens** = any substance that can harm the developing offspring in the womb
        + **Fetal Alcohol Syndrome(FAS)** = developmental problems caused by excessive consumption of alcohol on the mother's part
            - Symptoms include mis-sized head or death

#### Infant Behavior
- **Infant Reflexes** = behaviors hard-coded into the infant's brain
    * Rooting = turns mouth towards anything that touches their face
    * Grasping = fingers will curl around an object placed in their hand
    * Stepping = legs will take steps instinctually if held up
    * Sucking = will place any object near face into their mouth
    * Startle(Moro) = throws arms out, arches back, and grabs onto something
    * Babinski = curls toes when feet are tickled

#### Sensory Development
- Depth perception
    * Emerges around 6th month
    * **Visual Cliff Experiment** = babies will just crawl off the edge of a fall
- Sight
    * **Habituation** = a trend of decreasing response when frequency of exposure is increased
        + Babies get bored with your stupid toys
