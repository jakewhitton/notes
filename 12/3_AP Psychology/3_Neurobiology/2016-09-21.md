#Neural Communication

**Biological Psychology** = aspect of psychology concerned with physical ways neurons cooperate to compose mental processes
- Names:
    * Behavioral Neuroscientists
    * Neuropsychologists
    * Behavior Geneticists
    * Physiological Psychologists
    * Biopsychologists

#### Phrenology
- The study of the shape of skull and the making of inferences based off of that shape
    * Bumps on head indicate abilities or traits
- Developed by Franz Gall

###The Neuron

Anatomy:

  - Soma = body of the cell
    * Receives action potentials from dendrites
  - Dendrites = branching bodies that connect to other dendrites or axon terminals
    * Receive action potentials via **neurotransmitters**
  - Axon = long, thin barrel with myelin sheath that uses electrotonic potential to relay signals from soma to axon terminals
    * Covered with myelin sheath to split transmission into brief, fast electrotonic potentials and connecting action potentials to keep voltage high
  - Myelin sheath = waxy layer composed of **Schwann Cells**
    * Serves to insulate stretches of the axon so that electrotonic potential can happen, speeding up transmisison
  - *Nodes of Ranvier* = gaps inbetween the myelin sheathing that allows an action potential to happen, keeping the voltage within the cell high enough to ensure the signal isn't lost
  - Synapse
    * The area where two neurons come near to each other
    * Cite of neurotransmitter release and intake


Action Potential Process

  - Begin at resting potential(-70mV inside neuron)
  - Stimulus opens Na+ channels and tons of sodium ions flow in
    * **Polarization**
  - After a threshold is reached, K+ gates open, letting K+ out.  Voltage drops as a result
    * **Depolorization**
  - After a while, Sodium-Potassium pumps begin to create the gradient
    * **Repolarization**

Drugs that Target Neurotransmitters

  - Action potential at dendrite is stimulated by neurotransmitter, typically
  - Drugs can fit in those receptors
  - **Antagonist**
    * The drug fits, but poorly; as a result, the *real* neurotransmitter can't fit
    * **Inhibits** the targetted neurotransmitter
  - **Agonist**
    * The drug fits *really* well and simulates the neurotransmitter
    * **Excites** the neurotransmitter or increases activity
