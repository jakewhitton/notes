### Brain Scan
  - Electroencephalogram(EEG)
    * Places 8 electrodes around the brain and records electric brain activity
  - Computed Tomography Scan(CAT Scan)
    * X-ray photoraphs taken from different angles
    * A computer generates a composite image
  - Positron Emission Tomography Scan(PET Scan)
    * A radioactive form of glucose is ingested and sensors detect where glucose goes
  - Magnetic Resonance Imaging Scan(MRI Scan)
    * Large electromagnets and radio waves make water in the brain orient itself in line with the magnetic field
    * Can generate very high-detail images
