### Summary
  - Stages
    * Relieved Dolby Rescued Harry = mneumonic for remembering stages of action potential
      + **R**elieved = **R**esting
      + **D**olby = **D**epolorization
      + **R**escued = **R**epolorization
      + **H**arry = **H**
  - Ions
    * SIPO = mneumonic for remembering ions
      + **S**odium **I**n, **P**otassium **O**ut
  - Agonists vs Antagonists
    * Agonists = mimic effect of neurotransmitter
      + Nicotine, Morphine
    * Antagonists = block or inhibit effect of neurotransmitter


## The Nervous System
  - Nerves = small strands of neurons that act as highways for action potentials
    * Serve to connect brain to peripheral sensory organs
  - Nervous System = the organ system the body employs to communicate between organs
    * Composition
      + Nerve Cells
      + **Peripheral Nervous System(PNS)** = nerve framework that connects brain to peripheral sense organs
      + **Central Nervous System(CNS)** = the brain and spinal chord


### Model of Nervous System
    - Peripheral Nervous System
        * Autonomic Nervous System
            + Controls unconscious actions of organs
            + Sympathetic Nervous System = arousal
            + Parasympathetic Nervous System = calming effect
                + *Think of a parachute--slows you down*
        * Skeletal/Somatic Nervous System
            + Controls voluntary movement of skeletal muscle
    - Central Nervous System
        * Brain
        * Spinal Chord

### Types of Neurons
    - Sensory Neurons
        * Serve as medium through which sensory information travels to brain
        * Sense Organs -> Brain
            + Uses **affarent neurons**
        * Brain -> Sense Organs
            + Uses **efferent neurons**
        * Mneumonic = SAME
            + **S**ensory **A**ffarent **M**otor **E**fferent
    - Interneurons = linking neurons that connect other systems together
        * Only found in brain and spinal chord

### Reflexes
    - **Reflex** = a simple action undertaken via the **reflex arc**
    - **Reflex Arc** = a pathway of nerves through which a reflex happens
        * Generally goes from sensory organ -> affarent neurons -> interneurons -> spinal chord -> interneurons -> efferent neurons -> motor neurons

### Neural Networks
    - Neural Networks = a web of inter-connected neurons that cooperate to process information
    - Through experience and feedback, neural networks are modified
