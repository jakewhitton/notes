###The Neuron

Anatomy:

  - Soma = body of the cell
    * Receives action potentials from dendrites
  - Dendrites = branching bodies that connect to other dendrites or axon terminals
    * Receive action potentials via **neurotransmitters**
  - Axon = long, thin barrel with myelin sheath that uses electrotonic potential to relay signals from soma to axon terminals
    * Covered with myelin sheath to split transmission into brief, fast electrotonic potentials and connecting action potentials to keep voltage high
  - Myelin sheath = waxy layer composed of **Schwann Cells**
    * Serves to insulate stretches of the axon so that electrotonic potential can happen, speeding up transmisison
  - *Nodes of Ranvier* = gaps inbetween the myelin sheathing that allows an action potential to happen, keeping the voltage within the cell high enough to ensure the signal isn't lost
  - Synapse
    * The area where two neurons come near to each other
    * Cite of neurotransmitter release and intake


Action Potential Process

  - Begin at resting potential(-70mV inside neuron)
  - Stimulus opens Na+ channels and tons of sodium ions flow in
    * **Polarization**
  - After a threshold is reached, K+ gates open, letting K+ out.  Voltage drops as a result
    * **Depolorization**
  - After a while, Sodium-Potassium pumps begin to create the gradient
    * **Repolarization**

Drugs that Target Neurotransmitters

  - Action potential at dendrite is stimulated by neurotransmitter, typically
  - Drugs can fit in those receptors
  - **Antagonist**
    * The drug fits, but poorly; as a result, the *real* neurotransmitter can't fit
    * **Inhibits** the targetted neurotransmitter
  - **Agonist**
    * The drug fits *really* well and simulates the neurotransmitter
    * **Excites** the neurotransmitter or increases activity


Neurotransmitters

  - Dopamine
    * Used in movement, attention, and learning
    * Schizophrenia thought to be related to dopamine imbalance
      + Thought to be a surplus of dopamine
    * Parkinson's disease thought to be related to loss of dopamine-releasing neurons
      + Symptoms: 
        - Movements are difficult to control
        - Shaking while at rest
        - Stooping posture or rigidity
        - Unbalance
      + Treatments
        - L-dopa = agonist that immitates dopamine
        - Fetal tissue transplants
        - Adrenal gland transplants
        - Electrical stimulation of thalamus = stops shaking
    * Part of "reward system" or limbic system
  - Serotonin
    * Regulates sleeping patterns
    * Thought to be related to depression
      + Especially low-serotonin
      + High-serotonin is thought to cause mania
      + *Prozac* excites serotonin
        - **SSRI** = Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitor
          + Examples: Welbutrin, Zoloft, Celexa
  - Acetylcholine
    * First neurotransmitter we discovered
    * Abbreviated "ACh"
    * Used in motor neurons--stimulates muscles to contract
    * Used in learning, memory, and muscle contraction
    * Nicotine is an agonist for Norepinephrine and ACh
    * Thought to be related to Alzheiumer's Disease
      + Decay of memory, reasoning, and lanugage
  - Endorphins
    * Regulates pain/pleasure
    * Pain is a stimulus for release
    * Agonists
      + Morphine
      + Codeine
    * Explains "runners high"
  - Norepinephrine
    * Excitatory neurotransmitter that causes "fight or flight" response
    * Also related to depression
    * Used in physical arousal, learning, and memory
  - GABA
    * Inhibitory
    * Thought to be related to Huntington's disease = death of neurons in *stratium* that make use of GABA
      + Jerky movements
      + Cognitive deterioration
  - Glutamate
    * Very prevelant
    * Excitatory neurotransmitter
    * Excess glutamate and lack of GABA is associated with epilepsy


###Neurons can be Excitatory or Inhibitory
  - Excitatory = stimulates post-synaptic neuron to carry an action potential
  - Inhibitory = Causes post-synaptic neuron to be less likely to start an action potential
    * GABA



### Summary
  - Stages
    * Relieved Dolby Rescued Harry = mneumonic for remembering stages of action potential
      + **R**elieved = **R**esting
      + **D**olby = **D**epolorization
      + **R**escued = **R**epolorization
      + **H**arry = **H**
  - Ions
    * SIPO = mneumonic for remembering ions
      + **S**odium **I**n, **P**otassium **O**ut
  - Agonists vs Antagonists
    * Agonists = mimic effect of neurotransmitter
      + Nicotine, Morphine
    * Antagonists = block or inhibit effect of neurotransmitter


## The Nervous System
  - Nerves = small strands of neurons that act as highways for action potentials
    * Serve to connect brain to peripheral sensory organs
  - Nervous System = the organ system the body employs to communicate between organs
    * Composition
      + Nerve Cells
      + **Peripheral Nervous System(PNS)** = nerve framework that connects brain to peripheral sense organs
      + **Central Nervous System(CNS)** = the brain and spinal chord


### Model of Nervous System
  - Peripheral Nervous System
    * Autonomic Nervous System
      + Controls unconscious actions of organs
      + Sympathetic Nervous System = arousal
      + Parasympathetic Nervous System = calming effect
        - *Think of a parachute--slows you down*
    * Skeletal/Somatic Nervous System
      + Controls voluntary movement of skeletal muscle
  - Central Nervous System
    * Brain
    * Spinal Chord

### Types of Neurons
  - Sensory Neurons
    * Serve as medium through which sensory information travels to brain
    * Sense Organs -> Brain
      + Uses **affarent neurons**
    * Brain -> Sense Organs
      + Uses **efferent neurons**
    * Mneumonic = SAME
      + **S**ensory **A**ffarent **M**otor **E**fferent
  - Interneurons = linking neurons that connect other systems together
    * Only found in brain and spinal chord

### Reflexes
  - **Reflex** = a simple action undertaken via the **reflex arc**
  - **Reflex Arc** = a pathway of nerves through which a reflex happens
    * Generally goes from sensory organ -> affarent neurons -> interneurons -> spinal chord -> interneurons -> efferent neurons -> motor neurons

### Neural Networks
  - Neural Networks = a web of inter-connected neurons that cooperate to process information
  - Through experience and feedback, neural networks are modified


### Lesions
  - Lesions = destruction of tissue cause either naturally or by purpose
  - Walter Freeman = got Nobel Prize for procedure wherein he quickly caused damage to a part of the brain to cure depression or anxiety

    * Places 8 electrodes around the brain and records electric brain activity
  - Computed Tomography Scan(CAT Scan)
    * X-ray photoraphs taken from different angles
