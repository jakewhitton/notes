### Brainstem
- Oldest part of the brain
- Where spinal chord meets brain
- Controls involuntary physical processes
- **Medulla**
    * Controls
        + Breathing
        + Heart rate
        + Digestion
        + Swallowing
        + Coughing
        + Vomiting
        + Sneezing
- **Pons**
    * Controls coordinated motion
- **Reticular Formation**
    * Also called **Reticular Activating System(RAS)**
    * Controls
        + Sleep
        + Arousal
        + Attention

### Midbrain
- **Cerebellum**
    * Divided among the two hemispheres
    * Controls voluntary motions on a per-hemisphere basis
    * Lesions can result in
        + Jerky movements
        + Loss of balance
- **Thalmus**
    * Acts like a router for sense data
        + *Except* for smell
- **Hypothalmus**
    * Small control center
    * Controls
        + Sexual drive
        + Hunger
        + Thirst
        + Sleep
        + Regulating electrolyte concentration
        + Regulating body temperature
        + Circadian rythym
        + Hormone secretion
- **Amygdala**
    * Has a role in emotional processing
        + Especially recognizing facial expressions
    * Lesions can result in difficulty socializing
- **Hippocampus**
    * Primarily involved in forming new memories
        * **Anterograde amnesia** = inability to form new memories
    * Lesions associated with Alzheimer's Disease

### Outer Brain
- **Cerebral Cortex**
    * Thin layer of tissue that covers each hemisphere
    * Processes information
    * **Glial Cells** = specialized neurons that provde support, nourishment, and protectiond for surrounding neurons
    * Composed of 4 **lobes**
        + **Frontal Lobes**
            - Contains **motor cortex** at rear
            - Speaking
            - Muscle movement
            - Planning/Judging
        + **Parietal Lobes**
            - Contains **sensory cortex** at front
            - Processes information from **Somatic Nervous System**
        + **Occipital Lobes**
            - Processes visual sense data
            - **Remember**: *Occ*ular
        + **Temporal Lobe**
            - Contains **auditory cortex**
            - Processes auditory sense data
    * **Association Areas** = areas of the cerebral cortex not involved in motor or sensory functions
