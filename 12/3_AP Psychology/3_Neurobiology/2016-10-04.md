### The Cerebral Cortex Cont
  - Aphasia = difficulty with language
    * Associated with damage to Broca's area or Wernicke's area
    * Broca's Area
      + Brain area on left frontal lobe--controls muscles associated with speech
    * Wernicke's Area
      + Brain area in left temporal lobe--processes and understands language
    * Mneumonic: *You broca, you no seaka*
  - Neuroplasticity
    * the ability for neural networks to reform
    * Stronger the younger you are
  - Corpus Callosum
    * a collection of many, many neural fibers
    * Serves to connect two brain hemispheres
    * Conveys messages between areas of both hemispheres
  - Split Brain Procedure
    * Corpus Callosum is severed, seperating each hemisphere from one another
