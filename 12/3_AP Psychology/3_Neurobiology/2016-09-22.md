Neurotransmitters

  - Dopamine
    * Used in movement, attention, and learning
    * Schizophrenia thought to be related to dopamine imbalance
      + Thought to be a surplus of dopamine
    * Parkinson's disease thought to be related to loss of dopamine-releasing neurons
      + Symptoms: 
        - Movements are difficult to control
        - Shaking while at rest
        - Stooping posture or rigidity
        - Unbalance
      + Treatments
        - L-dopa = agonist that immitates dopamine
        - Fetal tissue transplants
        - Adrenal gland transplants
        - Electrical stimulation of thalamus = stops shaking
    * Part of "reward system" or limbic system
  - Serotonin
    * Regulates sleeping patterns
    * Thought to be related to depression
      + Especially low-serotonin
      + High-serotonin is thought to cause mania
      + *Prozac* excites serotonin
        - **SSRI** = Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitor
          + Examples: Welbutrin, Zoloft, Celexa
  - Acetylcholine
    * First neurotransmitter we discovered
    * Abbreviated "ACh"
    * Used in motor neurons--stimulates muscles to contract
    * Used in learning, memory, and muscle contraction
    * Nicotine is an agonist for Norepinephrine and ACh
    * Thought to be related to Alzheiumer's Disease
      + Decay of memory, reasoning, and lanugage
  - Endorphins
    * Regulates pain/pleasure
    * Pain is a stimulus for release
    * Agonists
      + Morphine
      + Codeine
    * Explains "runners high"
  - Norepinephrine
    * Excitatory neurotransmitter that causes "fight or flight" response
    * Also related to depression
    * Used in physical arousal, learning, and memory
  - GABA
    * Inhibitory


Neurons can be Excitatory or Inhibitory
  - Excitatory = stimulates post-synaptic neuron to carry an action potential
  - Inhibitory = Causes post-synaptic neuron to be less likely to start an action potential
    * GABA
