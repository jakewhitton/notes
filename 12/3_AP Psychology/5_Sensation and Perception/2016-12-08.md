### How Do We Sense Different Pitches?
- **Place Theory** = a theory that maps frequency space to the location of certain ciliated cells in the **cochlea**
    * The brain knows which pitch is being activated because it originates from a nerve that is tied to a certain part of the **cochlea**
- **Frequency Theory** = 

### Body Position and Movement
- **Kinesthesis** = the sense system that tracks the position of body parts
- **Vestibular Sense** = the *feeling* of where body parts are
    * *Vestibular* sacs
    * Involved in the sense of balance



### Perceptual Illusions
- **Muller-Lyer Illusion** = two line segments, if sufficiently separated will appear to be different lengths if
    * One of the line segments has arrows that form an acute angle with the perpandicular
    * One of the line segments has arrows that form an obtuse angle with the perpandicular
- **Ames Room** = uses the **Muller-Lyer** as well as staggered perspective

### Sight and Perception
- **Visual Capture** = the tendency for vision to overpower the other sights
- **Gestalt** = a whole that emerges from disperate parts
    * **Grouping** = the organization of perceptual entities into coherent groups
        + For example, you see a group of people as a whole rather than seeing each individual
        + Principles of grouping
            - **Proximity** = nearby entities are more likely to be grouped
            - **Similarity** = entities with similar properties are more likely to be grouped
            - **Continuity** = items that are whole and continuous are more likely to be grouped
            - **Closure** = grouping tendencies will fill in the gaps
            - **Connectedness** = disperate entities can be grouped if they are conneted or bridged
