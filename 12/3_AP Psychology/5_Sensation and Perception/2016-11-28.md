# Sensation and Perception

### What is Sensation?
- **Sensation** = the process by which action potentials that originate from sensory neurons are delivered to the brain
- **Perception** = the process by which sense data is processed and interpretted by the brain
- **Bottom-Up** = term that describes how **sensation** occurs
    * Low-level processing occurs early on in the transmission
    * The more high-level, pattern-recognition processing is done in the brain
- **Top-Down** = term that describes how **perception** occurs
    * Tasks are centrally organized by the brain

#### Psychophysics
- **Psychophysics** = the study of physical stimuli and how it affects behavior and mental processes
- **Stimuli** = any information that can be detected and interpretted by the brain
    * Light
    * Sound waves
    * Temperature
    * Pressure
- Thresholds
    * **Absolute Threshold** = the amplitude a stimuli must exhibit to be detected **50%** of the time
    * **Difference Threshold** = the difference in amplitude two stimuli must exhibit for people to perceive a **just noticeable difference** between them
        + **Just Noticeable Difference(JND)** = the perception of a slight difference in magnitude of two stimuli

#### Signal Detection Theory
- **Signal Detection Theory** = a theory that attempts to explain how stimuli are reliably perceived in the presence of lots of background stimuli
    * People's likelihood of perceiving faint stimuli in noisy backgrounds depends on
        + Experience
        + Expectation
        + Motivation
        + Fatigue
- **Subliminal** = a term that describes stimuli that are lower in amplitude than the **absolute threshold** needed to reliably perceive them
- **Weber's Law** = a law that states that the **difference threshold** depends on which *type* of stimuli you test
    * Light intensity must vary by 8% to be noticeable
    * Weight must vary by 2% to be noticeable
    * Tone frequency must vary by 0.3%
- **Sensory Adaptation** = the increased threshold of perception that comes with repeated exposure to a certain stimuli
    * Rather similar to **habituation**
- **Transduction** = the transformation of one form of energy to another
    * *eg.* Electromagnetic waves turning into action potentials
    * **Sensation** is the process of transduction from various media to action potentials
