# Sensation and Perception

### What is Sensation?
- **Sensation** = the process by which action potentials that originate from sensory neurons are delivered to the brain
- **Perception** = the process by which sense data is processed and interpretted by the brain
- **Bottom-Up** = term that describes how **sensation** occurs
    * Low-level processing occurs early on in the transmission
    * The more high-level, pattern-recognition processing is done in the brain
- **Top-Down** = term that describes how **perception** occurs
    * Tasks are centrally organized by the brain

#### Psychophysics
- **Psychophysics** = the study of physical stimuli and how it affects behavior and mental processes
- **Stimuli** = any information that can be detected and interpretted by the brain
    * Light
    * Sound waves
    * Temperature
    * Pressure
- Thresholds
    * **Absolute Threshold** = the amplitude a stimuli must exhibit to be detected **50%** of the time
    * **Difference Threshold** = the difference in amplitude two stimuli must exhibit for people to perceive a **just noticeable difference** between them
        + **Just Noticeable Difference(JND)** = the perception of a slight difference in magnitude of two stimuli

#### Signal Detection Theory
- **Signal Detection Theory** = a theory that attempts to explain how stimuli are reliably perceived in the presence of lots of background stimuli
    * People's likelihood of perceiving faint stimuli in noisy backgrounds depends on
        + Experience
        + Expectation
        + Motivation
        + Fatigue
- **Subliminal** = a term that describes stimuli that are lower in amplitude than the **absolute threshold** needed to reliably perceive them
- **Weber's Law** = a law that states that the **difference threshold** depends on which *type* of stimuli you test
    * Light intensity must vary by 8% to be noticeable
    * Weight must vary by 2% to be noticeable
    * Tone frequency must vary by 0.3%
- **Sensory Adaptation** = the increased threshold of perception that comes with repeated exposure to a certain stimuli
    * Rather similar to **habituation**
- **Transduction** = the transformation of one form of energy to another
    * *eg.* Electromagnetic waves turning into action potentials
    * **Sensation** is the process of transduction from various media to action potentials

### Vision
- **Accommodation** = the process of the lens contorting in order to focus the image on the **fovea**
- **Acuity** = the accuracy and sharpness of vision
    * Typically deteriorates with age
- **Nearsightedness** = a condition in which it is easier for objects near to the eyes to be seen
- **Farsightedness** = a condition in which it is easier for objects far from the eyes to be seen

#### Psychophysics of Vision
- **Hue** = basically the color that the light is
    * Determined by **frequency**/**wavelength**
- **Intensity** = amplitude of EM wave
    * Associated with how **bright** the color is
- **Wavelength** = distance between the crests of the wave
    * Larger wavelength is associated with lower frequency
- **Frequency** = the amount of oscillations the wave undergoes per second
    * Measured in Hertz(Hz)

#### Anatomy of the Eye
- **Cornea** = the outer protective layer that covers the eye
- **Pupil** opening of the eye that is adjustable in size when **iris** contracts or relaxes
    * Acts similar to camera shutter
        + If pupil is open, more light will make its way in
    * Pupil helps to adjust vision to changing light conditions
- **Iris** = a colored ring of muscle that contracts and relaxes to adjust the size of the pupil
- **Lens** = transparent structure that is behind the pupil that contorts to adjust the path of incoming light
    * Lens also inverts the image
        + We don't see the world as upside down because the brain flips the image
- **Retina** = a layer of light-sensitive cells that start an action potential if hit by certain kinds of light
    * **Rods** = detect the outline of shape
        + Cannot distinguish color
    * **Cones** = detect the color of objects
        + Cannot distinguish movement
    * **Transduction** = converting of electromagnetic energy into chemical potential energy
- **Fovea** = area of the **retina** that the lens focuses the image onto
    * Where all fine details are made out
- **Optic Nerve** = a bundle of nerve tissue that conveys action potentials from the retina to the brain
    * Causes a **blind spot**, because there are no **cones** or **rods** on the optic nerve
    * **Blind spot** = a area of the retina that cannot sense light
        + Caused by **optic nerve** and blood vessels

#### Processing Visual Information
- **Ganglion Cells** = cells that connect to **bipolar cells**
    * Axon connects to **optic nerve**
- **Bipolar Cells** = neurons that connect **rods** and **cones** to the **ganglion cells**
- **Optic chiasm** = physical point when optic nerve splits into two distinct nerve tracks
    * Each track leads to one hemisphere
- Process
    1. Transduction occurs on the **cones** and **rods** and an action potential is generated
    2. **Bipolar cells** convey action potential to the **ganglion cells**
    3. **Optic nerve**, made of **ganglion axons**, conveys the action potential to the **optic chiasm**
    4. At the **optic chiasm**, information is segregated onto separate paths to each hemisphere
    5. Each path leads to the **thalmus**
    6. The thalmus directs the action potentials to **visual cortex**
- **Parallel processing** = the simultaneous processing of several different aspects of a problem congruently
    * The brain performs this on
        + Color
        + Motion
        + Form
        + Depth
- **Trichromatic Theory of Color Vision** = a theory that explains how humans see color
    * Researched by **Young** and **Helmholtz**
    * Relies on principle that there are *three* **primary colors**
        + They discovered that using red, green, and blue, they could generate all possible colors
        + They postulated that there are *three* corresponding photoreceptors
- **Opponent-Process Theory** = a theory that attempts to explain after-image effects
    * Postulates *four* photorecptors
        + Red and green = opponents
        + Blue and yellow = opponents
    * Modern view of vision is a blend of **trichromatic theory** and **opponent-process theory**
- **Color constancy** = the phenomenon of the brain adjusting perception in different lighting conditions so that colors look the same
    * Color is fundamentally a psychological property, not a physical property
