#### Processing Visual Information
- **Ganglion Cells** = cells that connect to **bipolar cells**
    * Axon connects to **optic nerve**
- **Bipolar Cells** = neurons that connect **rods** and **cones** to the **ganglion cells**
- **Optic chiasm** = physical point when optic nerve splits into two distinct nerve tracks
    * Each track leads to one hemisphere
- Process
    1. Transduction occurs on the **cones** and **rods** and an action potential is generated
    2. **Bipolar cells** convey action potential to the **ganglion cells**
    3. **Optic nerve**, made of **ganglion axons**, conveys the action potential to the **optic chiasm**
    4. At the **optic chiasm**, information is segregated onto separate paths to each hemisphere
    5. Each path leads to the **thalmus**
    6. The thalmus directs the action potentials to **visual cortex**
- **Parallel processing** = the simultaneous processing of several different aspects of a problem congruently
    * The brain performs this on
        + Color
        + Motion
        + Form
        + Depth
- **Trichromatic Theory of Color Vision** = a theory that explains how humans see color
    * Researched by **Young** and **Helmholtz**
    * Relies on principle that there are *three* **primary colors**
        + They discovered that using red, green, and blue, they could generate all possible colors
        + They postulated that there are *three* corresponding photoreceptors
- **Opponent-Process Theory** = a theory that attempts to explain after-image effects
    * Postulates *four* photorecptors
        + Red and green = opponents
        + Blue and yellow = opponents
    * Modern view of vision is a blend of **trichromatic theory** and **opponent-process theory**
- **Color constancy** = the phenomenon of the brain adjusting perception in different lighting conditions so that colors look the same
    * Color is fundamentally a psychological property, not a physical property
