#### Depth Perception
- **Depth Perception** = the capacity for organisms to ascertain the relative positions of objects on the axis perpandicular to the frame eof vision
- **Binocular Cues** = information that the brain uses to indicate depth that only use one eye
    * **Retinal Disparity** = the retinas are located at two different locations
        + Allows the brain to calculate a kind of **parallax**
    * **Convergence**
        + The eyes retreat if the object being focused on is very close
            - Trying to get a larger distance so it can perceive depth better
        + The brain can *feel* this
- **Monocular Cues** = information that the brain uses to indicate depth that only use one eye
    * **Relative size** = objects that are far away take up less perceptual space
    * **Interposition** = if one object is blocked by another, the one in front is the superimposed one
    * **Relative clarity** = distant objects are more "hazy" or blurred
    * **Texture** = the more detail you can make out, the closer it is
    * **Relative height** = objects that are at different heights take up different perceptual spaces
        + Similar to **relative size**
    * **Relative motion** = Closer objects look like they're moving faster than distant objects, even if they're travelling at the same velocity
    * **Linear perspective** = the effect that parallell lines seem to converge in the distance
    * **Relative brightness** = closer objects seem *lighter*
    * **Light and shadow** = 
        + Light above, shadow below = looks like it pops out
        + Light below, shadow above = looks like it recesses in
        + Based on intuition that the light comes from above(the sun)

#### Motion
- **Phi Phenomenon** = when a string of lights blink in quick succession, the illusion of movement is created

#### Adjusting Perception
- **Perceptual Constancy** = the brain sees objects as unchanging even though light conditions may be changing
    * *eg.* Color constancy
- **Ponzo Illusion** = our tendency to perceive overlayed lines on a picture as lengths that make sense in the context of the photo
- **Perceptual Adaptation** = the capacity for the brain to adjust an artificially manipulated sense of vision to conform to its expected form
    * *eg.* Upside-down glasses
- **Perceptual Set** = the propensity to perceive one thing in an ambiguous object rather than as another thing
- **Stroop Effect** = the effect that that descibes how words that are colored and spell out a word different from their color is confusing
    * Explained by a **left-right conflict**

##### Is There Such a Thing As Extrasensory Perception?
- **Parapsychology** = the study of paranormal phenomenon
    * **ESP** = the claim that perception can be influenced by external forces other than sensation
    * **Psychokinesis** = the ability to move objects just with the brain
        + Also called **telekinesis**
        + *lol.*
- **Extrasensory Perception** = the capacity to perceive things that are apart from their sensory input
    * **Telepathy** = the ability to communicate with other people's mind
    * **Clairvoyance** = the ability to perceive events that one has not observed
        + NOT events in the future
    * **Precognition** = the ability to perceive future events
