# Basic Economic Concepts

## What is Economics?
- **Economics** = the "science" of **scarcity**
    * **Scarcity** = the premise that resource availability is finite
    * Economic "actors" make decisions on how to allocate resources
        + Economics is also called the science of **choices**

### A Note About This Class
- This class is about **Macroeconomics**
    * **Macroeconomics** = an aspect of economics concerned with the higher-level details of how markets operate
        + Especially how governments can affect market trends
- **Economics(textbook definition)** = a social science that deals with how to efficiently allocate scarce resources such that the "actor" in question attains maximum satisfaction
    * *Flawed premise?*

### Micro vs Macro
- **Microeconomics** = an aspect of economics concerned with lower-level details of smaller economic units
    * Examples
        + *How do specific markets operate?*
        + *How do monopolies affect profit?*
- **Macroeconomics** = an aspect of economics concerned with higher-level details of the entire economy
    * Examples
        + *How do we best model economic growth?*
        + *How can international trade affect domestic industries?*
        + *How can government spending influence the market?*

### How is Economics Used?
- In economics, the chasm between practical affect and theoretical affect is relatively large
    * Sometimes, economic theories do not have the intended consequences
    * **Theoretical Economics** = the use of economic methods of analysis to develop a coherent model of an aspect of the economy
    * **Policy economics** = an economic model in which theories are applied and modified to best seek certain economic outcomes
- **Positive Statement** = a matter-of-fact statement of what reality consists of
    * Ignores morality and ethics and expectation
- **Normative Statements** = an assessment of perceived societal ills and how to best address them
    * Less based in practicality--more theoretical

### Five Economic Assumptions
1. People's desires are unlimited, and commodities are *scarce*
2. Because of scarcity, choices must be made
    * In addition, each choice had trade-offs due to **opportunity cost**
3. Actors make decisions to maximize their satisfaction
    * Everyone is fundamentally self-interested
4. Decisions are made by comparing **marginal costs** and **marginal benefits** of each prospective option
5. Economic situations can be illuminated via simiplified models and graphs

### What are "Marginal" costs and benefits
- **Marginal** = a term that describes "additional"
    * *Think "margin"*
- **Marginal Analysis** = a methodology that relies on comparing value that stands to be created or destroyed as a result of certain actions
    * Think of *cost-benefit analysis*
- Premise: *people will continue to do something until the marginal costs are greater than the marginal benefits*
