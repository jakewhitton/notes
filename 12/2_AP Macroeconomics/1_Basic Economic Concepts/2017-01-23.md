### Price and its Relation to Quantity Demanded and Demand
- **BIGGEST RULE OF ALL RULES**: *price of a good **never** shifts the demand curve for that good*
    * Rather, there is an inverse relationship between price and quantity demanded
    * HOWEVER, the price of complement and supplement goods *will* change demand
- If **price** doesn't shift demand, what does?
    * Answer: *the five shifters of demand*

#### Five Shifters of Demand
1. Tastes and preferences
    * Different people like different things at different times
2. Number of consumers
    * If there are more consumers in an area, quantity demanded will increase across the board
3. Price of related goods
    * Demand curves of **complement goods** are tied together
        + *e.g.* Cereal shift in demand -> milk shift in demand
    * Demand curves of **substitute goods** are inversely related
        + *e.g.* Coffee demand decreases, tea demand increases
4. Income
    * Consumer purchasing power shifts and quantity demanded shifts across the board
    * **Normal goods** = a good whose demand curve is directly related to a shift in consumer goods
        + Think of them as *luxury* goods
        + Mo' money -> Mo' meaningless consumerism
    * **Inferior goods** = a good whose demand curve is inversely related to a shift in consumer purchasing power
        + Examples
            - Used cars
            - McDonalds
5. Consumer expectations
    * Hype about products shifts demand
