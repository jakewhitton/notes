### Scarcity
- In order to manage resources requires **government**
    * *Gasp... IT'S SOCIALISM*
        + Nah more like social democracy
- How are resources allocated differently under **capitalism** and **communism**?


## The Three Economic Questions
1. What goods and services should we produce?
2. How should these goods and services be produced?
3. Who consumes the goods and services produced?

### Political Ideology and the Three Questions
- The answers to *these* questions determines what **economic system** the society operates by
    * **Economic System** = the methods involved in how production and consumption take place
- Three **economic systems**
    1. Centrally-planned economy
        * Also called a "Command" economy
    2. Free market economy
    3. Mixed economy
        * What the US and most liberal democracies are

#### Centrally Planned Economies
- Characteristics
    * A government entity owns all the resources
    * A government entity answers the three questions
- *Why do centrally planned economies face problems of poor-quality goods, shortages, and unhappy citizens?*
    * Imperialism
    * Government bureaucracy
    * Apparently no incentive to work hard
        + Classic..  Just *classic*.

#### Free Market Economies
- **Laissez Faire** = "let it be"
    * Economic principle that the market is self-regulating and government regulation is just inefficient
- **Private property rights** = the legal and moral right to dictate how certain resources that are "owned" can be used and distributed
    * Private property is *key*
- **Profit-motive** = ~~people~~ entrepreneurs are motivated to create quality products because of **profit**
- **Invisible Hand of the Market** = pressures exerted on producers because of competition and self-interest
    * Free-market enthusiasts believe those pressures make the market efficient and *moral*

#### Mixed Economies
- *somewhat* of a mix between centrally planned economies and free-market economies
- The system that most modern liberal democracies are
    * Examples
        + United States
        + United Kingdom
        + Canada
        + France
        + *etc*
