### Trade-offs vs Opportunity Cost
- **Trade-offs** = all the choices that we *don't* make
    * All choices have trade-offs, by definition
    * We no longer stand to accrue the value of any of the choices we do not make
- **Opportunity cost** = the most valuable of all potential trade-offs
    * Kind of a placeholder for the largest sum of value you lose out on by going with the best choice
    * Possible to be used in the plural: opportunity cost**s**
        + The most valuable subset of size $n$ of the set of tradeoffs


### Some Economic Terminology
- **Utility** = satisfaction
    * Very hedonist definition of utility
    * Philosophers might disagree with that
- **Marginal** = additional
    * A term that describes values or costs that accrue as a result of making a choice
- **Allocate** = distribute
    * What marxist nonsense

### Price vs Cost
- **Price** = the value that **consumers** dispense of to obtain a product
    * Price is set by the **producer**
- **Cost** = the value that **producers** dispense of to create or refine a product
    * Cost is set by the market
- **Investment** = the process by which producers dispense of value to increase production or efficiency
    * **Consumer Goods** = a product created for providing utility to the consumer
    * **Capital Goods** = the factors of production
        + The utility that **capital goods** provide is used to produce a **consumer good** that is of utility to the **consumer**

### Four Factors of Production
1. **Land** = a catchall term for **capital goods** that do not originate from labor
    * Examples
        - Physical land
        - Drinkable water
        - Coal
        - Oil
2. **Labor** = the effort exerted to transform existing **consumer goods** into **capital goods**
    * Examples
        - Slave labor
        - Wage workers
3. **Capital**
    * **Physical Capital** = **capital goods** that are used to generate **consumer goods**
    * **Human Capital** = skills gained through practice
4. **Entrepeneurship** = individuals with the ideas and skill to create goods and services that are of value to the consumer
    * Role of Entrepeneurship
        + Takes initiative
        + Innovation
        + Assumes the risk of business ventures
    * Incentive is sweet, sweet **profit**
        + **Profit** = **Revenue** - **Costs**
            - **Revenue** = the sum of value obtained by selling the goods produced
