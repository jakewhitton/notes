### Trade


#### Why Do People Trade?
- *In general, **people** trade so that they can obtain goods they either don't have the means to produce themself or possess a high opportunity cost for producing it themself*
- In economics, people become **specialized** in labor
    * Different people are good at different things
    * As result people do what they're best at and then they *trade*
    * *Supposedly*, trade increases human welfare for both parties
        + Unless you're a third world country

#### Absolute and Comparative Advantage
- **Per unit Opportunity Cost** = basically just the opportunity cost per unit produced
- **Absolute Advantage** = a disparity in productive efficiency pertaining to some product
    * With respect to **output**, the nation with the *highest* output has the **absolute advantage**
    * With respect to **input**, the nation that can produce a unit of product using the *fewest* resources has the **absolute advantage**
- **Comparative Advantage** = a disparity in **per unit opportunity cost** pertaining to some product
    * The idea is that each nation should produce for what their opportunity cost is lowest
    * With respect to **output**, the nation with the lowest **per unit opportunity cost** has the **comparative advantage**
- Which is more important: **absolute** or **comparative** advantage?
    * It depends on the circumstances
        + If production *efficiency* is desired, then nations should specialize to produce the product they have the **comparitive advantage** for
        + If production *quantity* is desired, then nations should specialize to produce the product they have the **absolute advantage** for
            - *e.g.* Wartime arms production: the nation's safety is on the line
