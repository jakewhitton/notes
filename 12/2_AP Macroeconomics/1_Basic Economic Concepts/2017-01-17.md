### Types of Efficiency
- **Productive efficiency** = the extent to which the productive capacity of a society is being fully utilized
    * All points along the **ppf** are equally *productively efficient*
- **Alocative efficiency** = the extent to which the permutation of production possibilities aligns with what the society at large desires
    * If a point isn't along the **ppf**, then it is not efficient in the productive or allocative capacity
