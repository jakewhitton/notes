### Production Possibilities Frontier(PPF)
- Also called the **production possibilities curve(PPC)**
- A model of how resources can be allocated to produce commodities
    * Useful for demonstrating scarcity, trade-offs, opportunity cost, and efficiency
- Four assumptions
    1. There are only two commodities can be produced
    2. Theoretical 0% unemployment rate
        * *Perfect efficiency*
    3. We have a finite, fixed amount of resources
        * *Ceteris Paribus* = fixed resources
    4. We have a stagnant amount of technology
        * If technology were changing when we were producing our **PPF**, then our graft would be shifting constantly

#### Example of PPF

#### Economics Based on the PPF
- Each point is a *possible* production scheme
    * If you chose any one point, your **trade-offs** are all the other points
- **Efficiency** = the line represents *perfect efficiency* of resource utilization
    * If your production is plotted *below* the curve, there is present some source of inefficiency
        + Unemployment, etc
    * If your production is plotted *above* the curve, then you are high
        + It is by definition *more* than perfectly efficient, which isn't possible
- **Opportunity cost** is represented by the slope of the curve at any given point
    * **Constant opportunity cost** = a situation wherein the **ppf** is a straight line
    * **Law of Increasing Opportunity Cost** = a theorem that stipulates that in most **ppf** curves, the opportunity cost(slope of the line) increases in magnitude
        + Think of the bowed curve; the "negative-ness" of the slope constantly increases
        + Resources do not linearly transfer between the requisites for producing two commodities
            - What if the resources are *currency*?
            - Commodity A costs some amount x per unit
            - Commodity B costs some amount y per unit
            - The linear rate of exchange between A and B should just be the ratio $\frac{x}{y}$

#### How Can the PPF Shift?
1. Change in the quantity of resources or the efficiency by which we can use existing resources
2. Change technology--extract resources more efficiently, produce more efficiently
3. Trade
    * If two countries have different optimal points, they can trade to make each other better off
    * Trade balance is typically in favor of those who produce **capital goods**
