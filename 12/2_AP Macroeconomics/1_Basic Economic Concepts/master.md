# Basic Economic Concepts

## What is Economics?
- **Economics** = the "science" of **scarcity**
    * **Scarcity** = the premise that resource availability is finite
    * Economic "actors" make decisions on how to allocate resources
        + Economics is also called the science of **choices**

### A Note About This Class
- This class is about **Macroeconomics**
    * **Macroeconomics** = an aspect of economics concerned with the higher-level details of how markets operate
        + Especially how governments can affect market trends
- **Economics(textbook definition)** = a social science that deals with how to efficiently allocate scarce resources such that the "actor" in question attains maximum satisfaction
    * *Flawed premise?*

### Micro vs Macro
- **Microeconomics** = an aspect of economics concerned with lower-level details of smaller economic units
    * Examples
        + *How do specific markets operate?*
        + *How do monopolies affect profit?*
- **Macroeconomics** = an aspect of economics concerned with higher-level details of the entire economy
    * Examples
        + *How do we best model economic growth?*
        + *How can international trade affect domestic industries?*
        + *How can government spending influence the market?*

### How is Economics Used?
- In economics, the chasm between practical affect and theoretical affect is relatively large
    * Sometimes, economic theories do not have the intended consequences
    * **Theoretical Economics** = the use of economic methods of analysis to develop a coherent model of an aspect of the economy
    * **Policy economics** = an economic model in which theories are applied and modified to best seek certain economic outcomes
- **Positive Statement** = a matter-of-fact statement of what reality consists of
    * Ignores morality and ethics and expectation
- **Normative Statements** = an assessment of perceived societal ills and how to best address them
    * Less based in practicality--more theoretical

### Five Economic Assumptions
1. People's desires are unlimited, and commodities are *scarce*
2. Because of scarcity, choices must be made
    * In addition, each choice had trade-offs due to **opportunity cost**
3. Actors make decisions to maximize their satisfaction
    * Everyone is fundamentally self-interested
4. Decisions are made by comparing **marginal costs** and **marginal benefits** of each prospective option
5. Economic situations can be illuminated via simiplified models and graphs

### What are "Marginal" costs and benefits
- **Marginal** = a term that describes "additional"
    * *Think "margin"*
- **Marginal Analysis** = a methodology that relies on comparing value that stands to be created or destroyed as a result of certain actions
    * Think of *cost-benefit analysis*
- Premise: *people will continue to do something until the marginal costs are greater than the marginal benefits*

### Practice Choice

> You want to visit your friend for a week.  You will return Sunday night.
>
> You work every weekday earning $100 per day
>
> There are three flights available
>     - Thursday night flight($275)
>     - Friday Early Morning flight($300)
>     - Friday night flight($325)


### Trade-offs vs Opportunity Cost
- **Trade-offs** = all the choices that we *don't* make
    * All choices have trade-offs, by definition
    * We no longer stand to accrue the value of any of the choices we do not make
- **Opportunity cost** = the most valuable of all potential trade-offs
    * Kind of a placeholder for the largest sum of value you lose out on by going with the best choice
    * Possible to be used in the plural: opportunity cost**s**
        + The most valuable subset of size $n$ of the set of tradeoffs


### Some Economic Terminology
- **Utility** = satisfaction
    * Very hedonist definition of utility
    * Philosophers might disagree with that
- **Marginal** = additional
    * A term that describes values or costs that accrue as a result of making a choice
- **Allocate** = distribute
    * What marxist nonsense

### Price vs Cost
- **Price** = the value that **consumers** dispense of to obtain a product
    * Price is set by the **producer**
- **Cost** = the value that **producers** dispense of to create or refine a product
    * Cost is set by the market
- **Investment** = the process by which producers dispense of value to increase production or efficiency
    * **Consumer Goods** = a product created for providing utility to the consumer
    * **Capital Goods** = the factors of production
        + The utility that **capital goods** provide is used to produce a **consumer good** that is of utility to the **consumer**

### Four Factors of Production
1. **Land** = a catchall term for **capital goods** that do not originate from labor
    * Examples
        - Physical land
        - Drinkable water
        - Coal
        - Oil
2. **Labor** = the effort exerted to transform existing **consumer goods** into **capital goods**
    * Examples
        - Slave labor
        - Wage workers
3. **Capital**
    * **Physical Capital** = **capital goods** that are used to generate **consumer goods**
    * **Human Capital** = skills gained through practice
4. **Entrepeneurship** = individuals with the ideas and skill to create goods and services that are of value to the consumer
    * Role of Entrepeneurship
        + Takes initiative
        + Innovation
        + Assumes the risk of business ventures
    * Incentive is sweet, sweet **profit**
        + **Profit** = **Revenue** - **Costs**
            - **Revenue** = the sum of value obtained by selling the goods produced

### Scarcity
- In order to manage resources requires **government**
    * *Gasp... IT'S SOCIALISM*
        + Nah more like social democracy
- How are resources allocated differently under **capitalism** and **communism**?


## The Three Economic Questions
1. What goods and services should we produce?
2. How should these goods and services be produced?
3. Who consumes the goods and services produced?

### Political Ideology and the Three Questions
- The answers to *these* questions determines what **economic system** the society operates by
    * **Economic System** = the methods involved in how production and consumption take place
- Three **economic systems**
    1. Centrally-planned economy
        * Also called a "Command" economy
    2. Free market economy
    3. Mixed economy
        * What the US and most liberal democracies are

#### Centrally Planned Economies
- Characteristics
    * A government entity owns all the resources
    * A government entity answers the three questions
- *Why do centrally planned economies face problems of poor-quality goods, shortages, and unhappy citizens?*
    * Imperialism
    * Government bureaucracy
    * Apparently no incentive to work hard
        + Classic..  Just *classic*.

#### Free Market Economies
- **Laissez Faire** = "let it be"
    * Economic principle that the market is self-regulating and government regulation is just inefficient
- **Private property rights** = the legal and moral right to dictate how certain resources that are "owned" can be used and distributed
    * Private property is *key*
- **Profit-motive** = ~~people~~ entrepreneurs are motivated to create quality products because of **profit**
- **Invisible Hand of the Market** = pressures exerted on producers because of competition and self-interest
    * Free-market enthusiasts believe those pressures make the market efficient and *moral*

#### Mixed Economies
- *somewhat* of a mix between centrally planned economies and free-market economies
- The system that most modern liberal democracies are
    * Examples
        + United States
        + United Kingdom
        + Canada
        + France
        + *etc*

### Production Possibilities Frontier(PPF)
- Also called the **production possibilities curve(PPC)**
- A model of how resources can be allocated to produce commodities
    * Useful for demonstrating scarcity, trade-offs, opportunity cost, and efficiency
- Four assumptions
    1. There are only two commodities can be produced
    2. Theoretical 0% unemployment rate
        * *Perfect efficiency*
    3. We have a finite, fixed amount of resources
        * *Ceteris Paribus* = fixed resources
    4. We have a stagnant amount of technology
        * If technology were changing when we were producing our **PPF**, then our graft would be shifting constantly

#### Example of PPF
- INSERT GRAPH 1-1 here

#### Economics Based on the PPF
- Each point is a *possible* production scheme
    * If you chose any one point, your **trade-offs** are all the other points
- **Efficiency** = the line represents *perfect efficiency* of resource utilization
    * If your production is plotted *below* the curve, there is present some source of inefficiency
        + Unemployment, etc
    * If your production is plotted *above* the curve, then you are high
        + It is by definition *more* than perfectly efficient, which isn't possible
- **Opportunity cost** is represented by the slope of the curve at any given point
    * **Constant opportunity cost** = a situation wherein the **ppf** is a straight line
    * **Law of Increasing Opportunity Cost** = a theorem that stipulates that in most **ppf** curves, the opportunity cost(slope of the line) increases in magnitude
        + Think of the bowed curve; the "negative-ness" of the slope constantly increases
        + Resources do not linearly transfer between the requisites for producing two commodities
            - What if the resources are *currency*?
            - Commodity A costs some amount x per unit
            - Commodity B costs some amount y per unit
            - The linear rate of exchange between A and B should just be the ratio $\frac{x}{y}$

#### How Can the PPF Shift?
1. Change in the quantity of resources or the efficiency by which we can use existing resources
2. Change technology--extract resources more efficiently, produce more efficiently
3. Trade
    * If two countries have different optimal points, they can trade to make each other better off
    * Trade balance is typically in favor of those who produce **capital goods**

### Types of Efficiency
- **Productive efficiency** = the extent to which the productive capacity of a society is being fully utilized
    * All points along the **ppf** are equally *productively efficient*
- **Alocative efficiency** = the extent to which the permutation of production possibilities aligns with what the society at large desires
    * If a point isn't along the **ppf**, then it is not efficient in the productive or allocative capacity

### Trade


#### Why Do People Trade?
- *In general, **people** trade so that they can obtain goods they either don't have the means to produce themself or possess a high opportunity cost for producing it themself*
- In economics, people become **specialized** in labor
    * Different people are good at different things
    * As result people do what they're best at and then they *trade*
    * *Supposedly*, trade increases human welfare for both parties
        + Unless you're a third world country

#### Absolute and Comparative Advantage
- **Per unit Opportunity Cost** = basically just the opportunity cost per unit produced
- **Absolute Advantage** = a disparity in productive efficiency pertaining to some product
    * With respect to **output**, the nation with the *highest* output has the **absolute advantage**
    * With respect to **input**, the nation that can produce a unit of product using the *fewest* resources has the **absolute advantage**
- **Comparative Advantage** = a disparity in **per unit opportunity cost** pertaining to some product
    * The idea is that each nation should produce for what their opportunity cost is lowest
    * With respect to **output**, the nation with the lowest **per unit opportunity cost** has the **comparative advantage**
- Which is more important: **absolute** or **comparative** advantage?
    * It depends on the circumstances
        + If production *efficiency* is desired, then nations should specialize to produce the product they have the **comparitive advantage** for
        + If production *quantity* is desired, then nations should specialize to produce the product they have the **absolute advantage** for
            - *e.g.* Wartime arms production: the nation's safety is on the line

## Demand
- **Demand** = a metric of how *willing* and how *able*
- **Law of Demand** = **price** is inversely related to **quantity demanded**
    * Why does the law of demand *work*?
        1. **Substitution Effect** = *if the price of a product changes, consumers may change habits by purchasing a substitute*
            + Only affects the **quantity demanded**
        2. **Income Effect** = *if the price of a product changes, the **purchasing power** of consumers increases*
            + They are able to purchase *more*
        3. **Law of Diminishing Marginal Utility** = *the per-unit utility of a product is inversely related to the quantity purchased*
- **Demand Schedule** = the permutation of **prices** and **quantity desired** that the consumer would act in accordance with
    * A demand curve is just a graphical representation of a **demand schedule**
        + Is downward-sloping, because of the three factors
    * When interpretting the data, one should assume all else being equal(income, etc)
        + *ceteris paribus*
