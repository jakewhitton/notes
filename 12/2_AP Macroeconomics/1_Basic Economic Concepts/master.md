# Basic Economic Concepts

## What is Economics?
- **Economics** = the "science" of **scarcity**
    * **Scarcity** = the premise that resource availability is finite
    * Economic "actors" make decisions on how to allocate resources
        + Economics is also called the science of **choices**

### A Note About This Class
- This class is about **Macroeconomics**
    * **Macroeconomics** = an aspect of economics concerned with the higher-level details of how markets operate
        + Especially how governments can affect market trends
- **Economics(textbook definition)** = a social science that deals with how to efficiently allocate scarce resources such that the "actor" in question attains maximum satisfaction
    * *Flawed premise?*

### Micro vs Macro
- **Microeconomics** = an aspect of economics concerned with lower-level details of smaller economic units
    * Examples
        + *How do specific markets operate?*
        + *How do monopolies affect profit?*
- **Macroeconomics** = an aspect of economics concerned with higher-level details of the entire economy
    * Examples
        + *How do we best model economic growth?*
        + *How can international trade affect domestic industries?*
        + *How can government spending influence the market?*

### How is Economics Used?
- In economics, the chasm between practical affect and theoretical affect is relatively large
    * Sometimes, economic theories do not have the intended consequences
    * **Theoretical Economics** = the use of economic methods of analysis to develop a coherent model of an aspect of the economy
    * **Policy economics** = an economic model in which theories are applied and modified to best seek certain economic outcomes
- **Positive Statement** = a matter-of-fact statement of what reality consists of
    * Ignores morality and ethics and expectation
- **Normative Statements** = an assessment of perceived societal ills and how to best address them
    * Less based in practicality--more theoretical

### Five Economic Assumptions
1. People's desires are unlimited, and commodities are *scarce*
2. Because of scarcity, choices must be made
    * In addition, each choice had trade-offs due to **opportunity cost**
3. Actors make decisions to maximize their satisfaction
    * Everyone is fundamentally self-interested
4. Decisions are made by comparing **marginal costs** and **marginal benefits** of each prospective option
5. Economic situations can be illuminated via simiplified models and graphs

### What are "Marginal" costs and benefits
- **Marginal** = a term that describes "additional"
    * *Think "margin"*
- **Marginal Analysis** = a methodology that relies on comparing value that stands to be created or destroyed as a result of certain actions
    * Think of *cost-benefit analysis*
- Premise: *people will continue to do something until the marginal costs are greater than the marginal benefits*

### Practice Choice

> You want to visit your friend for a week.  You will return Sunday night.
>
> You work every weekday earning $100 per day
>
> There are three flights available
>     - Thursday night flight($275)
>     - Friday Early Morning flight($300)
>     - Friday night flight($325)


### Trade-offs vs Opportunity Cost
- **Trade-offs** = all the choices that we *don't* make
    * All choices have trade-offs, by definition
    * We no longer stand to accrue the value of any of the choices we do not make
- **Opportunity cost** = the most valuable of all potential trade-offs
    * Kind of a placeholder for the largest sum of value you lose out on by going with the best choice
    * Possible to be used in the plural: opportunity cost**s**
        + The most valuable subset of size $n$ of the set of tradeoffs


### Some Economic Terminology
- **Utility** = satisfaction
    * Very hedonist definition of utility
    * Philosophers might disagree with that
- **Marginal** = additional
    * A term that describes values or costs that accrue as a result of making a choice
- **Allocate** = distribute
    * What marxist nonsense

### Price vs Cost
- **Price** = the value that **consumers** dispense of to obtain a product
    * Price is set by the **producer**
- **Cost** = the value that **producers** dispense of to create or refine a product
    * Cost is set by the market
- **Investment** = the process by which producers dispense of value to increase production or efficiency
    * **Consumer Goods** = a product created for providing utility to the consumer
    * **Capital Goods** = the factors of production
        + The utility that **capital goods** provide is used to produce a **consumer good** that is of utility to the **consumer**

### Four Factors of Production
1. **Land** = a catchall term for **capital goods** that do not originate from labor
    * Examples
        - Physical land
        - Drinkable water
        - Coal
        - Oil
2. **Labor** = the effort exerted to transform existing **consumer goods** into **capital goods**
    * Examples
        - Slave labor
        - Wage workers
3. **Capital**
    * **Physical Capital** = **capital goods** that are used to generate **consumer goods**
    * **Human Capital** = skills gained through practice
4. **Entrepeneurship** = individuals with the ideas and skill to create goods and services that are of value to the consumer
    * Role of Entrepeneurship
        + Takes initiative
        + Innovation
        + Assumes the risk of business ventures
    * Incentive is sweet, sweet **profit**
        + **Profit** = **Revenue** - **Costs**
            - **Revenue** = the sum of value obtained by selling the goods produced
