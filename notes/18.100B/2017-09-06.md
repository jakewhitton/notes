    * 2-272
- Office hours
    * Tuesday 3:00PM - 4:00PM
    * Friday 3:00PM - 4:00PM
- Important that you read all that is assigned
- PSETs due on Wednesdays

## Homework policies
- Collaboration is encouraged
    * But no copying
        + Any observed copying will result in a zero
    * If you didn't collaborate, write "no consultation"
- Allowed one automatic extension without penalty
    * No excuse needed
    * All other late work is graded for half-credit

## Textbook
- Called "Baby Rudin"
    * Has some problems
        + It's efficient and doesn't hold your hand
        + Unclear as to what is the **important** ideas
            - Things hidden in excercises are important
        + No graphics
        + Generally very difficult to read

## Overview of Class
- Goals
    1. Learn foundations of calculus, series, and differential equations
    2. Learn to read and write "rigorous" math
- Continuation classes
    - 18.101 Analysis and Manifolds
    - 18.102 Introduction to Functional Analysis
    - 18.103
    - 18.112
    - 18.901
- Number theory makes heavy use of analysis

# And So it Begins

## What is $e$?
- $e = \lim{n \to \infty} \big(1 + \frac{1}{n} \big)^n$
- $e = \sum_{n = 0}^{\infty} \frac{1}{n!}$
- ln was first created, but $log_10$ was used because it could make calculation books simpler

## Forier series
- When Forier series were developed, it raised questions about the nature of real numbers
- $\sum_{n = 1}^{\infty} \frac{sin(nx)}{n} = \frac{\pi}{2} - x$
- MIT researcher looked at $\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} a_n(w) \frac{sin(nx)}{n}$
    * Where $a_n(w)$ are called **Gaussian random variables**
        + Meant to represent Brownian motion

## Key question
- _How do we determine the distance between two functions?_
    * Maybe $d(f, g) = |f(x) - g(x)|$
- Actually, our notion of distance can affect problems
    * For some problems, $d = \int_0^\pi$

## Back to our question: What are real numbers?
- **Field** = a set with addition and multiplication defined
    * Also must set some axioms
        + Must be closed under addition
        + Must satisfy commutative addition
        + Must satisfy associative addition
        + Must havce a zero element that completes identity
        + Must satisfy the existence of an additive inverse
        + Must satisfy associated multiplicative axioms
        + Must satisfy distributive property
    * Different from vector spaces
- **Ordered set**
    *
- **Ordered field**
