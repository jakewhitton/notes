# What is linguistics?
- **Linguistics** = the study of the universality and the variation of language
  across the planet
    * Interesting questions that surround the study
        + *What aspects of language are innate, and what aspects are learned from
        the linguistic environment the person comes from?*
        + *How does the capacity humans have for language relate to abilities
        that other members of the animal kingdom exibhit (echolocation,
        nest-building, coordinated migration, etc)?*
- Many different facets of language can be studied
    * Different aspects of language themselves (syntax, semantics, phonetics, etc)
    * The sociology/antropology of languages in the world
    * The biological/psychological/phenomenological study of language usage
    and language acquisition
        + **Critical period** = the stretch of time during which language
        acquisition seems to be incredibly accelerated and enabled by elements
        in a child's psychology or biology

# What is language?
- Language has a *representation* in the form of sounds, symbols, or gestures
    * **Phonetics** = the study of the human ability to generate sound
- Language encodes meaning, and interpretting a language is a process of
  decoding that meaning
    * **Semantics** = the decoding of how units of language are organized to
    communicate meaning
    * **Pragmatics** = the decoding of implicature and of structures that denote
    higher level concepts like tone or intention
- There are also aspects of language that lie in between
    * **Lexicon** = the capacity the brain has to store information about the
    language (eg remembering words, grammar rules, etc)
        + Part of language acquisition is learning the mapping from a continuous
        audio signal to a series of discrete units
        + Importantly, all vocal languages have some concept of a **word**,
        because it's conceptually the only way the lexicon can grow
