## Cranberry Morpheme
- **Cranberry morpheme** = a bound morpheme that communicates no semantic or
  grammatical meaning
    * Also called a **fossilized term**
- In some situations, words come into the language with several morphemes, but
  the meaning of the constituent morphemes gets muddled over time
    * *e.g.*
        + re-ceive  $\rightarrow$ re-cept-ion
        + per-ceive $\rightarrow$ per-cept-ion
        + de-ceieve $\rightarrow$ de-cept-ion
        + sub-mit $\rightarrow$ sub-miss-ion
        + e-mit $\rightarrow$ e-miss-ion
        + trans-mit $\rightarrow$ trans-miss-ion
    * The fact that ceive $\rightarrow$ cept and mit $\rightarrow$ miss suggests
    that they are independent morphemes, since it is evidence of them having
    allomorphs
