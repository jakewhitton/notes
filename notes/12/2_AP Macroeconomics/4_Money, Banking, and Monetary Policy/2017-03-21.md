### The Financial Sector
- **Financial sector** = a web of entitites that link people who want to borrow with people who want to lend
    * *e.g.*
        + Banks
        + Mutual funds
        + Pension funds
    * **Assets** = anything tangible or intangible that is owned
    * **Liability** = outstanding debts or obligations
    * **Loan** = an agreement between a lender and a borrower to give some assets from the lender to the borrower
        + Typically is associated with an **interest rate**

### Personal Finance vs Investment
- This class is focused on Macroeconomics, so **personal finance** isn't really covered
    * **Personal finance** = the method by which individuals and small economic units allocate assets to be spent and saved
- The business equivalent of spending is **investment**
    * This grows capital stock and increases real GDP

### Bonds vs Stock
- **Bond** = an agreement where individuals or small economic units lend assets to a larger institution(*e.g.* the government)
    * Owning a bond is like owning a promise that the money will be paid back in the future, with interest
    * These investments hold little risk, so their interest rate is smaller
        + If interest rate of bond market *decreases*, then demand for current bonds will decrease, and older bonds will raise in demand
    * Bonds do **not** transfer a stake in the organization
        + Rather, it's just debt
- **Stock** = an agreement where economic entities purchase a proportion of ownership of a private enterprise
    * This kind of investment is more risky
        + Because the company you are investing in could be successful or unsuccessful
    * Different from **bonds** because return on investment is not guaranteed
- **KEY POINT**: bond price and interest rates are inverseley related

### Time Value of Money
- Essential idea is that money *now* has a different value from money in the future
- This can be thought of in a few ways
    * **Interest rates**: there's an opportunity cost associated with using the money now rather than saving
    * **Human psychology**: I want it all and I want it now
        + *plz.*
- Present value of money
$$ Present\ Value = \frac{P}{(1 + R)^N} $$
- where $P$ is prinicple, $R$ is rate per compound iteration, and $T$ is the number of times that the principle compounds over the time period
- Future value of money
$$ Future\ Value = P (1 + R)^N $$
- where $P$ is prinicple, $R$ is rate per compound iteration, and $T$ is the number of times that the principle compounds over the time period

## Demand For Money
- **Transaction demand for money** = there is some level of current demand for everyday transactions
    * People need a medium of exchange for daily necessities
- **Asset demand for money** = there is some level of current demand for less liquid assets
    * This is because non-liquid assets are less risky
        + There is an inverse relationship between liquidity and risk

### Interest Rates and Demand For Money
- As interest rates increase, the opportunity cost of immediate consumption is higher
    * So, people invest in lower-liquidity assets
- As interest rates decrease, the opportunity cost of immediate consumption is lower
    * This is because putting away money to accrue interest won't give you much return
- In general, there is an inverse relationship between interest rates and quantity of money demanded
- Shifters of money demand curve
    1. Inflation/Deflation
        * If prices suddenly change, your saving habits change, and demand for money changes
    2. Changes in income
        * If income changes, your saving habits change, and demand for money changes
    3. Changes in technology
