## Why Do We Use Currency?
- Currency is a **medium of exchange**
    * This means that currency is the intermediate commodity between transactions
    * Instead of **bartering**, we can use currency for exchange
        + Problems with bartering
            1. **Double Coincidence of Wants** = both parties must actively want each others goods
                - Currency fixes this, as one person can desire a good, and the seller can desire the purchasing power associated with some amount of money
            2. Some goods cannot be split into smaller denominations
                - Currency fixes this by being offered in everything from pennies to hundred dollar bills
- **Wealth** = the totality of someone's assets
    * Assets include
        + Land
        + Capital
        + Labor power
            - *You damn commie*
- **Income** = the rate at which someone's wealth changes with time

### Commodity Currency vs Fiat Currency
- **Commodity currency** = a system of currency where the item of exchange has **intrinsic utility** to people
    * **Intrinsic utility** = a use or benefit that exists *within* the item of exchange
    * *e.g.*
        + Slips of paper that can be turned in at any time for food or water
        + Gold standard
            - The intrinsic utility of gold is doubtful, but I guess some people are stupid and like shiny things
- **Fiat currency** = a system of currency where the item of exchange has only **extrinsic utility** to people
    * **Extrinsic utility** = a use or benefit that exists *externally* to the item of exchange
        + This means that money is not useful in and of itself--aside from maybe warmth if you burn it
    * *e.g.*
        - Basically every modern economy(USD, Euro, British pound, etc)
        - I.O.U.'s

### Three Functions of Currency
1. **Medium of exchange** = the currency can be easily used to purchase goods and services
    *
2. **Unit of account** = producers use the currency to broadcast the prices of their goods or services
    * If all the shops are charging for sheckles, you're going to be justifiably confused
3. **Store of value** = the currency can be saved
    * Explains why spoilable goods do not make for good currency

### What Makes for a Good Currency?
1. **Widely accepted** = similar to the "unit of account" idea
    * Fiat currency is valuable if we all think it is
2. **Scarcity** = cannot be easily reproduced
3. Dividable into smaller denominations
- **Purchasing power** = the amount of goods and services a unit amount of currency can purchase
- **Inflation/Deflation** = the process of changing purchasing power with time
    * Can be caused by all kinds of things

### Liquidity
- **Liquidity** = the difficulty by which an asset can be used as a medium of exchange
- Three levels
    1. **M1(Highest liquidity)**
        * *e.g.*
            + Circulating currency
            + Checking accounts
    2. **M2(Near-Moneys)**
        * *e.g.*
            + All of M1
            + Invested currency
    3. **M3(Unliquid)**
        * *e.g.*
            + Assets that cannot be easily transfered

### The Financial Sector
- **Financial sector** = a web of entitites that link people who want to borrow with people who want to lend
    * *e.g.*
        + Banks
        + Mutual funds
        + Pension funds
    * **Assets** = anything tangible or intangible that is owned
    * **Liability** = outstanding debts or obligations
    * **Loan** = an agreement between a lender and a borrower to give some assets from the lender to the borrower
        + Typically is associated with an **interest rate**

### Personal Finance vs Investment
- This class is focused on Macroeconomics, so **personal finance** isn't really covered
    * **Personal finance** = the method by which individuals and small economic units allocate assets to be spent and saved
- The business equivalent of spending is **investment**
    * This grows capital stock and increases real GDP

### Bonds vs Stock
- **Bond** = an agreement where individuals or small economic units lend assets to a larger institution(*e.g.* the government)
    * Owning a bond is like owning a promise that the money will be paid back in the future, with interest
    * These investments hold little risk, so their interest rate is smaller
        + If interest rate of bond market *decreases*, then demand for current bonds will decrease, and older bonds will raise in demand
    * Bonds do **not** transfer a stake in the organization
        + Rather, it's just debt
- **Stock** = an agreement where economic entities purchase a proportion of ownership of a private enterprise
    * This kind of investment is more risky
        + Because the company you are investing in could be successful or unsuccessful
    * Different from **bonds** because return on investment is not guaranteed
- **KEY POINT**: bond price and interest rates are inverseley related

### Time Value of Money
- Essential idea is that money *now* has a different value from money in the future
- This can be thought of in a few ways
    * **Interest rates**: there's an opportunity cost associated with using the money now rather than saving
    * **Human psychology**: I want it all and I want it now
        + *plz.*
- Present value of money
$$ Present\ Value = \frac{P}{(1 + R)^N} $$
- where $P$ is prinicple, $R$ is rate per compound iteration, and $T$ is the number of times that the principle compounds over the time period
- Future value of money
$$ Future\ Value = P (1 + R)^N $$
- where $P$ is prinicple, $R$ is rate per compound iteration, and $T$ is the number of times that the principle compounds over the time period

## Demand For Money
- **Transaction demand for money** = there is some level of current demand for everyday transactions
    * People need a medium of exchange for daily necessities
- **Asset demand for money** = there is some level of current demand for less liquid assets
    * This is because non-liquid assets are less risky
        + There is an inverse relationship between liquidity and risk

### Interest Rates and Demand For Money
- As interest rates increase, the opportunity cost of immediate consumption is higher
    * So, people invest in lower-liquidity assets
- As interest rates decrease, the opportunity cost of immediate consumption is lower
    * This is because putting away money to accrue interest won't give you much return
- In general, there is an inverse relationship between interest rates and quantity of money demanded
- Shifters of money demand curve
    1. Inflation/Deflation
        * If prices suddenly change, your saving habits change, and demand for money changes
    2. Changes in income
        * If income changes, your saving habits change, and demand for money changes
    3. Changes in technology

## Money Supply
- The **federal reserve** tries to change interest rates by manipulating **money supply**
    * **Money supply** = the total amount of currency in an economy
    * On the interest rates vs quantity graph, it is vertical
        + Similar to LRAS
    * The equilibrium point is where money demand(MD) and money supply(MS) intersect
    * This tool is called **monetary policy**
        + A right shift is an *increase* in the money supply
        + A left shift is a *decrease* in the money supply

![Money Supply/Demand Graph](./assets/01.png)

### Money Supply and Aggregate Demand
- Because the demand for money(MD) is downward sloping, a change in money supply creates a new equilibrium point
    * The new interest rate will change the rate at which businesses invest
        + This shifts aggregate demand
- An increase in MS causes
    1. A lower equilibrium interest rate
    2. More investment
    3. Higher AD
    4. Lower unemployment
    5. Higher price level
- A decrease in MS causes
    1. A higher equilibrium interest rate
    2. Less investment
    3. Lower AD
    4. Higher unemployment
    5. Lower price level

### Fractional Reserve Banking
- **Fractional reserve banking** = the practice of banks using its customers deposits as the source for loans
    * Usually isn't a problem, because people only occasionally come to withdraw
        + But, if a massive recession hits, and everyone goes and demands their deposits, that would be a problem
            - This situation is called a **bank run**
    * Banks are required by law to hold at least some percentage of deposits available
        + This amount is called the **required reserves**
        + The remaining assets that can be loaned are called the **excess reserves**
- **Demand deposits** = an event where some economic entity deposits currency into a private checking account
    * Bank thinks to itself: *oooooooohh, I won't lend this to idiots.  Probably*
        + Really the bank planned on loaning it to idiots the whole time
- **Balance sheet** = a metric of the net wealth of a bank
    * Considers
        + Assets
        + Liabilities
        + Net worth
