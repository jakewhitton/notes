## Why Do We Use Currency?
- Currency is a **medium of exchange**
    * This means that currency is the intermediate commodity between transactions
    * Instead of **bartering**, we can use currency for exchange
        + Problems with bartering
            1. **Double Coincidence of Wants** = both parties must actively want each others goods
                - Currency fixes this, as one person can desire a good, and the seller can desire the purchasing power associated with some amount of money
            2. Some goods cannot be split into smaller denominations
                - Currency fixes this by being offered in everything from pennies to hundred dollar bills
- **Wealth** = the totality of someone's assets
    * Assets include
        + Land
        + Capital
        + Labor power
            - *You damn commie*
- **Income** = the rate at which someone's wealth changes with time

### Commodity Currency vs Fiat Currency
- **Commodity currency** = a system of currency where the item of exchange has **intrinsic utility** to people
    * **Intrinsic utility** = a use or benefit that exists *within* the item of exchange
    * *e.g.*
        + Slips of paper that can be turned in at any time for food or water
        + Gold standard
            - The intrinsic utility of gold is doubtful, but I guess some people are stupid and like shiny things
- **Fiat currency** = a system of currency where the item of exchange has only **extrinsic utility** to people
    * **Extrinsic utility** = a use or benefit that exists *externally* to the item of exchange
        + This means that money is not useful in and of itself--aside from maybe warmth if you burn it
    * *e.g.*
        - Basically every modern economy(USD, Euro, British pound, etc)
        - I.O.U.'s

### Three Functions of Currency
1. **Medium of exchange** = the currency can be easily used to purchase goods and services
    *
2. **Unit of account** = producers use the currency to broadcast the prices of their goods or services
    * If all the shops are charging for sheckles, you're going to be justifiably confused
3. **Store of value** = the currency can be saved
    * Explains why spoilable goods do not make for good currency

### What Makes for a Good Currency?
1. **Widely accepted** = similar to the "unit of account" idea
    * Fiat currency is valuable if we all think it is
2. **Scarcity** = cannot be easily reproduced
3. Dividable into smaller denominations
- **Purchasing power** = the amount of goods and services a unit amount of currency can purchase
- **Inflation/Deflation** = the process of changing purchasing power with time
    * Can be caused by all kinds of things

### Liquidity
- **Liquidity** = the difficulty by which an asset can be used as a medium of exchange
- Three levels
    1. **M1(Highest liquidity)**
        * *e.g.*
            + Circulating currency
            + Checking accounts
    2. **M2(Near-Moneys)**
        * *e.g.*
            + All of M1
            + Invested currency
