## Aggregate Supply In the Long Run
- Generally, a shift of aggregate demand will correspond with a long-term opposite shift in aggregate supply
    * For example, an increase in AD will result in a higher equillibrium price, and eventually input costs will increase(i.e. wage pressure) causing a decrease in AS
    * If AD decreases, equillibrium price will decrease, so producers will scale their production down
        * With less demand for inputs(labor, resources, etc), their price will go down
            + That decrease in input costs causes an increase in AS
- **Capital stock** = the amount of capital goods purchased or produced by an economy to increase output
    * This is the *only* thing that can shift the LRAS line
