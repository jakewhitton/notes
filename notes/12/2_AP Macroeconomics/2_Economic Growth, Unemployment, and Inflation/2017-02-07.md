## Calculating GDP
- There are generally two methods
    1. **Expenditures approach** = sum up all expenses that qualify for GDP
    2. **Income approach** = sum up all incocme that qualifies for GDPa
- Ideally *both* of these approaches should be roughly equal

### Four Parts of GDP
1. Consumer spending(~70%)
    * Essentially just private individuals using income to purchase and consume goods and servicecs
2. Investment(~15%)
    * NOTE: this is **not** stock market purchases or bonds, as those do not qualify for domestic production
    * Rather, investment is when businesses invest capital back into the economy
        + Examples
            - Loans
            - Self-driving cars
3. Government spending(20%)
    * **NOT** transfer payments
    * Rather, things like schools and military equiptment
4. Net exports
    * Formula is essentially just
$$ \Sigma X = X - M $$
    * where X is exports and M is imports
