## The Three Goals of Any Economy
1. Promote economic growth
    * Provide more jobs for more people
2. Limit unemployment
    * Unemployment limits growth by inhibiting production and decreasing consumer spending
3. Limitm inflation
    * High inflation discourages long-term investment

### How Do We Check Up On the Economy?
- Economists love them some statistics on production, income, investment, and savings
    * **National income accounting** = a method of economic analysis that looks at the overall health of an economy by analysing certain figures
- **Gross Domestic Product(GDP)** = the market value of all final goods and services produced *domestically* annually
    * Only accounts for **final goods**
        + **Final goods** = the end-result of production/labor
            - This prevents GDP from being inflated by counting each step in production as its own good
    * Formula for calculating *change*
$$ \% = \frac{GDP_f - GDP_i}{GDP_i} \times 100 $$
    * GDP is just a metric of total domestic production
        + This leads us to believe that larger countries are "better" than smaller production
            - To avoid that misconception, we use GDP-per-capita
$$ GDP_{per-capita} = \frac{GDP}{population} $$
            - According to the almighty authority on economis, GDP-per-capita is the *best* indicator of standard of living

### Why Do Certain Nations Have Higher GDP's?
- The ultimate authority says: **productivity**
    * **Economic system** = capitalism is inherently superior to your inferior commie system
    * **Property rights** = because the factors of production are privately owned, we are all somehow more efficient
        + *Don't ask why.*
    * **Capital**
        + **Capital stock** = esentially just a synonym for physical capital
        + **Human capital** = knowledge, skills, education, etc
    * **Natural resources** = oil af

### What **Doesn't** GDP Measure?
- GDP doesn't account for
    * Intermediate goods
    * Non-productive transactions
        + *e.g.*
            - Stock market purchases
            - Used goods
    * Illegally traded goods

## Calculating GDP
- There are generally two methods
    1. **Expenditures approach** = sum up all expenses that qualify for GDP
    2. **Income approach** = sum up all incocme that qualifies for GDPa
- Ideally *both* of these approaches should be roughly equal

### Four Parts of GDP
1. Consumer spending(~70%)
    * Essentially just private individuals using income to purchase and consume goods and servicecs
2. Investment(~15%)
    * NOTE: this is **not** stock market purchases or bonds, as those do not qualify for domestic production
    * Rather, investment is when businesses invest capital back into the economy
        + Examples
            - Loans
            - Self-driving cars
3. Government spending(20%)
    * **NOT** transfer payments
    * Rather, things like schools and military equiptment
4. Net exports
    * Formula is essentially just
$$ \Sigma X = X - M $$
    * where X is imports and M is imports
