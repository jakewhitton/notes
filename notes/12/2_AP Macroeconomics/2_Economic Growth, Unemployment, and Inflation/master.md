## The Three Goals of Any Economy
1. Promote economic growth
    * Provide more jobs for more people
2. Limit unemployment
    * Unemployment limits growth by inhibiting production and decreasing consumer spending
3. Limitm inflation
    * High inflation discourages long-term investment

### How Do We Check Up On the Economy?
- Economists love them some statistics on production, income, investment, and savings
    * **National income accounting** = a method of economic analysis that looks at the overall health of an economy by analysing certain figures
- **Gross Domestic Product(GDP)** = the market value of all final goods and services produced *domestically* annually
    * Only accounts for **final goods**
        + **Final goods** = the end-result of production/labor
            - This prevents GDP from being inflated by counting each step in production as its own good
    * Formula for calculating *change*
$$ \% = \frac{GDP_f - GDP_i}{GDP_i} \times 100 $$
    * GDP is just a metric of total domestic production
        + This leads us to believe that larger countries are "better" than smaller production
            - To avoid that misconception, we use GDP-per-capita
$$ GDP_{per-capita} = \frac{GDP}{population} $$
            - According to the almighty authority on economis, GDP-per-capita is the *best* indicator of standard of living

### Why Do Certain Nations Have Higher GDP's?
- The ultimate authority says: **productivity**
    * **Economic system** = capitalism is inherently superior to your inferior commie system
    * **Property rights** = because the factors of production are privately owned, we are all somehow more efficient
        + *Don't ask why.*
    * **Capital**
        + **Capital stock** = esentially just a synonym for physical capital
        + **Human capital** = knowledge, skills, education, etc
    * **Natural resources** = oil af

### What **Doesn't** GDP Measure?
- GDP doesn't account for
    * Intermediate goods
    * Non-productive transactions
        + *e.g.*
            - Stock market purchases
            - Used goods
    * Illegally traded goods

## Calculating GDP
- There are generally two methods
    1. **Expenditures approach** = sum up all expenses that qualify for GDP
    2. **Income approach** = sum up all incocme that qualifies for GDPa
- Ideally *both* of these approaches should be roughly equal

### Four Parts of GDP
1. Consumer spending(~70%)
    * Essentially just private individuals using income to purchase and consume goods and servicecs
2. Investment(~15%)
    * NOTE: this is **not** stock market purchases or bonds, as those do not qualify for domestic production
    * Rather, investment is when businesses invest capital back into the economy
        + Examples
            - Loans
            - Self-driving cars
3. Government spending(20%)
    * **NOT** transfer payments
    * Rather, things like schools and military equiptment
4. Net exports
    * Formula is essentially just
$$ \Sigma X = X - M $$
    * where X is imports and M is imports

### Income Appraoch to Calculating GDP
- The model essentially boils down to 4 **factor payments**
    1. Labor income = essentially just the wages individuals earn
    2. Rental income = the income generated by owning something and renting it out
    3. Interest income = the income generated by interest on loans
    4. Profit = the income generated by exploiting the working class

## Nominal GDP vs Real GDP
- **Inflation** = a rise in costs
- **Nominal GDP** = non-inflation adjusted GDP
    * For example, the nominal GDP-per-capita of the United States in 1970 was 5,246.96 USD-1970
- **Real GDP** = inflation-adjusted GDP
    * This is what's actually used to make comparisons in purchasing power between periods

### Business Cycle
- **Business cycle** = a model of the economy that relates real GDP with time
    * The curve has an overall increasing trend line
        + However, the economy goes through periods of boom and bust
        + Visually, the curve snakes around an "ideal" line of full employment
            - Periods of time where the curve is above the line is **inflation**
            - Periods of time where the curve is below the line is **unemployment**
    * **Recession** = a period of decline in real GDP that lasts for 6 months
        + If significantly longer, it is a **depression**

## Unemployment
- **Unemployment rate** = the ratio of the able-bodied population that is looking for a job but hasn't gotten hired yet
$$ \%_{Unemployed} = \frac{Q_{unemployed}}{Q_{labor force}} * 100 $$
- where $Q_{unemployed}$ is the number of unemployed persons in an economy and $Q_{labor force}$ is the number of persons that are in the **labor force**
    * **Labor force** = the part of the population that is considered as employed or potentially employable
        + Must be above 16 years old
        + Able and willing to work
        + Not institutionalized
            - *i.e.* prison, mental hospitals, etc
        + Not serving in military, a full-time student, or retired


### Three Types of Unemployment
1. **Frictional unemployment** = a type of unemployment characterized by apt workers that are between jobs or temporarily unemployed
    * **Seasonal unemployment** = a type of **frictional unemployment** characterized by working periods being *seasonal*
        + *e.g.* a Santa clause impersonator
2. **Structural Unemployment** = a type of unemployment characterized by the skills of the labor force becoming obselete
    * Especially relevant *now*, as automation changes the economic landscape
    * **Creative destruction** = a term that describes the process of these kinds of jobs disappearing
    * **Technological unemployment** = a specific type of **structural unemployment** driven by automation
3. **Cyclical unemployment** = a type of unemployment that is caused by the effects of a recession
    * Due to recssions, consumer demand decreases across the board, and companies respond with a reduced demand for labor
        + Cyclical unemployment is also called "demand deficient unemployment"

### Natural Rate of Unemployment
- **Natural Rate of Unemployment(NRU)** = the rate of unemployment that is deemed "normal" for an economy not in recession
    * Based on frictional and structural unemployment
- **Full employment output(Y)** = the real GDP generated if an economy does not experience cyclical unemployment
    * So, "full employment" is really just an "acceptable" unemployment calculated with frictional and structural unemployment rates
        + For the United States, "full employment" is at ~5% unemployment
