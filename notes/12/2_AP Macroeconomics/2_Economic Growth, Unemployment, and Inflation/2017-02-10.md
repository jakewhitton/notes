### Shortcomings of Unemployment Metrics
- The **unemployment rate** does not consider **discouraged workers**
    * Thus, people that get exhausted and burnt out with looking for a job ultimately aren't captured in this metric
        + As such, the unemployment rate can drop just by an increase in discouraged workers
- **Underemployed worker(part-time worker)** = a worker that wants to work *more*, but cannot find that employment
- Inequality
    * Employment descrimination is technically illegal, but it still happens
    * Basis varies
        + Race
        + Age
        + Sex
