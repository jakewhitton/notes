## What is "Inflation"?
- **Inflation** = a general rise in the price of goods
    * In effect, inflation reduces the **purchasing power** of consumers
    * Each unit of currency is worth less in physical goods
- **Disenflation** = a lowering in the rate at which inflation happens
    * NOT a reversal, just a slowing down
- **Nominal wage** = a wage that _isn't_ adjusted for inflation
- **Real wage** = a wage that is adjusted for inflation

### How Do We Measure It?
- **Inflation rate** = the rate at which prices rise from year to year
$$ \%_{I} = \frac{P_f - P_i}{P_i} $$
- The government keeps tabs on the fluctuations of costs for certain **market baskets**
    * **Market basket** = a collection of goods that is used to track inflation over time
- **Consumer Price Index(CPI)** = a metric of inflation that relies on this market basket approach
    * Essentially, CPI is just the inflation rate for a very specific collection of goods whose prices are thought to be related

### Is it Good or Bad?
- Generally, economists see rampant inflation as *bad*
    * Because it discourages investment because of the volitility of the dollar
- However, some economists believe that short-term inflation can be beneficial to the economy
    * Especially if the economy is in a severe recession
- What about **deflation**?
    * **Deflation** = a general decrease in the price of goods
        + Can be very bad because resources are hoarded, inhibiting growth
