### Problems With CPI
1. **Substitution Bias** = the demand for two substitute goods might shift, and the CPI will only test *one* of them
    * As a result, it looks like prices went up or down, but really they just shifted to a different good
2. **New products** = new market baskets need to be constantly created
3. **Product quality** = CPI only accounts for *price* change
    * If price change, CPI assumes that the product is the *same*, even if the product is better or higher quality
        + CPI is blind to improvements, so increases in CPI can be deceiving

### Three Causes of Inflation
1. Change in the **quantity** of currency
    * If the government prints more currency, each individual dollar becomes less valuable
    * Called the **quantity theory**
        + **Velocity** = the average number of times a piece of currency changes hands
$$ M V = P Y $$
        + where $M$ is **money supply**, $V$ is **velocity**, $P$ is **price level**, and $Y$ is **quantity of output**
            - We tend to assume that **velocity** is constant
    * **Hyperinflation** = a situation that can arise when a government prints new money to pay off debts
        + As a result, banks do not lend, halting growth
        + Examples
            - Bolivia
            - Peru
            - Brazil
            - Germany post WW1
2. **Demand-Pull Inflation**
    * Essentially, just an overall increase in demand
        + The demand curve shifts, resulting in a new **equillibrium price**
3. **Cost-Push Inflation**
    * Essentially, an increase in input costs
        + Suppliers have to raise prices to skim off the same profit margin
        + **Negative supply shock** = some kind of event that causes a sudden decrease in supply of some input
            - *e.g.* oil spill
