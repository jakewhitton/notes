## Supply
- **Supply** = a term that describes producers propensity to produce a certain number of **quantity supplied** for any given **price**
    * **Quantity supplied** = the number of units of a product produced
        + If price is *high*, producers want to produce more to take advantage of the higher profit margin
        + If price is *low*, producers want to produce less to mitigate loss
- **Law of Supply** = *there is a positive correlation between quantity supplied and price*

### Five Shifters of Supply
1. Price/supply of inputs to production
    * *e.g.* labor costs are higher due to those pesky communists demanding a livable wage
2. Number of sellers
    * if there are *more* sellers, overall supply increases
        + If demand stays constant, that results in a **equilibrium price** decrease
            - **Equilibrium price** = the price at which **quantity demanded** and **quantity supplied** are equal
3. Technology
    * *Typically* technology progression results in more efficient utilization of resources
        + Leads to an increase in supply
4. Government Taxes & Subsidies
    * Government offen subsidizes small business to maintain competition in the market
5. Expectations of Future Profit
    * Production goes where the profit is
        + If future price of good is expected to be high, production *now* will increase

### Price and Supply
- Just like demand, **price** of a good NEVER shifts supply for that good
    * Rather, the supply curve relates *each* price to a corresponding quantity supplied

### Surplus and Shortage
- **Surplus** = a term that describes a situation in which quantity supplied is *greater* than quantity demanded
- **Shortage** = a term that describes a situation in which quantity supplied is *less* than quantity demanded
- Theoretically, the market will adjust by raising or lowering the price to make up for a **shortage** or **surplus**
