            - Due to 17th Amendment, senators are now popularly elected

### Districts
- For the assignment of representatives, **districts** are drawn
    * **District** = a section of the state in question
    * The candidate with the plurality in that district wins the seat
    * If a state has *x* representatives, they draw *x* districts
- **Redistricting** = the process of state legislatures re-drawing district boundaries
    * Meant to be a mechanism through which the electoral process keeps up to date with a changing population
    * Happens when a new census is done
    * Results in **Gerrymandering** = the drawing of districts to benefit one party
        + Cram as many of the opposing party into a few, concentrated districts
        + Let the rest of the districts be a narrow but predictable victory for your party

### Incumbency
- **Incumbency** = the state of seeking re-election
- After cold war, there is a large increase in "career politicians"
    * People are seeking stability and level-headedness
- Advantage in advertising and visibility
- **Franking Privileges** = ability to use existing infrastructure to communicate with constituents at no cost
    * Primarily mail system = they can send postage for free
        + FREE ADVERTISING

- **Credit Claiming**
    * **Casework** = individual help provided to constituents
    * **Pork Barrel** = projects or grants that specifically benefit certain districts/states
        + Tangible things: roads, bridges, highways, hospitals, schools, etc

        + Like the "add your pork" instruction on the Mock bill assignment
        + Less tangible
- **Position Taking** = the act of portraying one's self as hardworking, principled individuals
    * Can be easier to back up if you have a good voting record
- Much of the time, opponents to incumbents are poorly funded and disorganized in comparison
- *Why do incumbents ever lose?*
    * Scandals
    * Gerrymandering puts them at a disadvantage
    * Anti-government sentiment

        + Each state gets 1 to start with, even if they don't have that much population
    * 2-year terms in office
        + Constantly re-elected
        + Makes the House the institution of government closest to the people
    * Responsible for all spending/taxing bills = **power**
    * Debate time is limited == **rule**
        + This is because there are 435 PEOPLE
    * General role = regulate spending
- Senate
    * 100 members
        + Each state gets 2 members
    * Is responsible for federal appointments and foreign affairs = **power**

## The President

### Big Ideas
- What is the *structure* of the presidency?
- Executive branch is the one that runs the government


### Structure of the Executive
- **Act with Dispatch**
    * Described in federalist paper #70
- Founded on principle of **separation of powers**
- **Formal** requirements for office
    * Must be 35 years or older
    * Must have resided in US for at least 14 years
        + Serves to protect country for foreign interests
    * Must be a natural-born citizen

        + Hillary Clinton got fairly far, but we still haven't had a female president or president-elect
    * Must be Christian
        + Almost always Protestant, except JFK, who was Catholic
- Typically, the Presidency is occupied by someone who hold former office in a governmental role


### Structure of the "Term"
- Terms are defined as to last for 4 years
- **22nd Amendment** = Presidents are limited to two terms
    * Pushed through because FDR served for... like... infinity

### Practice FRQ
> American politics has been  called an "invitation to struggle."  Although in recent years the president has been thought to have an advantage in policy-making, there are still constraints on the power of the president.
>
> a. Describe a power of the president in each of the following roles
>     - Chief legislator
>     - Chief bureaucrat or chief administrator

#### Answer
- **Vetoing a bill**:  If a bill passes through Congress, the president can move to veto said bill.  This amounts to barr the bill from being signed into law, effectively killing the bill unless Congress can override with a supermajority.
- **Appointing to the Bureaucracy**:  The president has the power to appoint certain people to different positions as the head of certain bureaucratic agencies.  For example, President Obama made Hillary Clinton, who lost in the Democratic primary to Obama, as Secretary of State.  This power allows the president to excercise power as Chief Administrator by choosing *who* to appoint to said positions.


### Inside the White House
- The **Vice President** actually has very few Constitutional duties
    * As a result, the **President** typically appoints the **Vice President** to an important cabinet position
    * VP's function to **balance the ticket**
        + **Balance the ticket** = make the campaign more widely supported by packing a *more* appealing VP to win more states
- **Cabinet** = body composed of advisors to the President
    * Members serve as Secretaries of various Federal Departments
        + Does count as a federal appointment--must be approved by Senate
- **Executive Office** = a body of members that do **not** belong to the bureaucracy
    * Has the role of **briefing** the president of information
        + Said info is received from collaboration between the **Cabinet** and the **Executive Office**
    * Because they are not federal appointments, they are **not** confirmed by the Senate
    * *Four* main associations
        + **National Security Council(NSC)**
        + **Council of Economic Advisors(CEA)**
        + **Office of Management and Budget(OMB)**
        + **White House Office** = a body composed of staff and chief aides
            - Typically chosen on basis of loyalty
            - **Because** they are members of the executive office, they do **not** need to be appointed by the Senate
- **First Lady** = the romantic partner of the President
    * No official constitutional role
    * Typically run initiatives that focus on single issues
        + Michelle Obama = childhood obesity
        + Hillary Clinton = healthcare

### The Dynamics of Shared Power
- The **president** and **Congress** need to cooperate in order for policy-making to happen
- **Checks and Balances**
    * **Veto** = the power to reject a bill that has been passed by Congress
        + Can be bypassed by a **two-thirds majority** of **both** houses
    * **Pocket Veto** = the power to refrain from signing a bill without actually vetoing it
        + The bill silently expires after 10 days
        + **Cannot** be overturned--effectively kills a bill
    * **Line Item Veto** = the power to veto **parts** of a bill
        + The president *used* to have this power, but it was overturned by the **Supreme Court**
        + State governors **do** have this power
    * **Presidential Mandate** = campaign promises that are backed by the president's wave of popularity
        + Mandates rarely develop into substantial policy, but they are claimed during campaigns anyway
- The president can act as **Chief Legislator**
    * Examples
        + Bargaining for certain policy
        + Utilizing their popularity to exert legislative pressure
        + Consulting with Congress
        + Issuing the **State of the Union** address
    * **Honeymoon Period** = defined as the first 100 days
        + Similar to how missing persons investigations consider the first 48 hours the critical period for finding leads
    * In this, the president acts as the **nation's key agenda builder**
-  The president can act as the **Head of State**
    * *Popularity* is the main way that the president can influence Congress
    * **Head of State** = the performing of a ceremonial function
        + Media gobbles it up

# 2016-12-02

### Approval Rates
- **Approval ratings** = rates of favorable views held on president
    * Mostly a result of extraneous factors that are out of the president's control
        * *eg.* George Bush Sr. benefits from economic explosion following the collapse of the Soviet Union
- Higher approval ratings gives the president more leverage over influencing legislative process
- Initially, approval rates are fairly high
    * *Why?*
        + Incumbents feel *familiar*
        + Washington outsiders feel *new*
        + Change still seems possible
        + **"Honeymoon" period** = sh bb I love u
- The role of the media
    * **Horserace Journalism** = focusing on approval ratings and polls rather than the content of policy
    * **Agenda-Setting** = can help modulate peoples' perspectives on the president

### The President and National Security Policy
- **Chief Diplomat** = the role the president fills when he/she advances foreign policy
    * Negotiate treaties
        + Must be ratified by Senate--president doesn't have **complete** control
    * Signing executive agreements
        + An example of an "informal" power of the president
    * Negotiating peace
    * Advocating for US allies abroad
- **Commander in Chief** = the role the president fills when he/she manages the military
    * The framers intended that the president would be a "civilian"
        + Ensures that the president is acting in the US's interests
        + Part of the rationale for granting the president the role of **Commander in Chief**
    * The president can dispatch troops without Congressional consent
- **War Powers Resolution** = an attempt to allieviate the tension between Congress and the President with regards to war
    * Central conflict = Congress can declare war without the president sending troops, and vice versa
    * Provisions
        + The president **must** consult with Congress before sending troops when possible
        + Congress **must** approve the continued stay of troops after 30 days
    * Most presidents have casually ignored it
    * Supreme court side-stepped it with the **political questions doctrine**
        + **Political questions doctrine** = the belief that certain issues belong to the domain of *politics*, rather than to the domain of constitutional law

### The Job of the President
- **Crisis manager** = the role the president fills when he/she serves as a consoling and managerial voice during the aftermath of a crisis
    * Has the potential to massively hurt or massively help approval ratings
    * Congress generally moves much slower than the president
        + Largely because Congress is a body of 535 senators and representatives, whereas the president is one rich white dude
- **Working with Congress**
    * Framers intended president to be sole agent of foreign policy
    * Political gridlock can severely damage approval ratings
- **Working with the Press**
    * The media and the president are often adversaries
    * Media focuses on the **personality** of the president rather than the **content** of his/her policy
- **Morale booster** = be a cheerleader for American freedom
- **Agenda setting**
    * Economic policy
    * Social policy
    * National security policy
- **Persuader** = attempt to convince segments of the population of the virtues of certain policy-positions

### Administrative Discretion
- The **bureaucracy** has the ability to selectively enforce policy
- A lot of power is placed in the hands of bureaucrats
- Often, policy is implemented across several agencies
    * Called **fragmentation**
    * Requires the collaboration of many agencies to effectively block the execution of a certain policy

### Why Do Some Policies Fail and Some Succeed?
- Reasons for failure
    1. Poor program design
    2. Lack of resources
    3. Ill-defined goal
        - Congress typically defines laws really vaguely
- Reasons for success
    1. Clear stated goal
    2. Was implemented in a non-objectionable way

### Regulation vs Deregulation
- **Regulation** = the excercising of control over some industry by passing legislation
    * Based on **incentives** and **disincentives**
    * Examples of **incentives**
        + Tax credits
        + Deductions
    * Examples of **disincentives**
        + Tax penalties
        + Fees
- **Deregulation** = the elimination of existing regulations
