#### How Do We Sense Different Pitches?
- **Place Theory** = a theory that maps frequency space to the location of certain ciliated cells in the **cochlea**
    * The brain knows which pitch is being activated because it originates from a nerve that is tied to a certain part of the **cochlea**
    * **Conductive Hearing Loss** = the physical system that directs sound to the tympanic membrane is damaged
- **Frequency Theory** = a theory that asserts that information on frequency and amplitude are actually contained in some substantial difference in the action potential
    * The brain pieces together what its hearing by analyzing the action potentials rather than the source of them
    * **Nerve Hearing Loss** = the nerves that convey auditory sense data are damaged, leading to hearing damage

### Chemical and Body Senses
- **Olfaction(Smell)**
- **Gustation(Taste)**
- **Touch and Temperature**
- **Pain**
- **Kinesthetic(relative locations of body parts)**
- **Vestibulari(balance)**

#### Touch Sensations
- **Pressure**
    * There are certain skin receptors that can sense changes in pressure
    * Essentially compose our sense of touch
- **Warmth/Cold** = a sense of the flow of heat in and out of the skin
- **Pain**

### Body Position and Movement
- **Kinesthesis** = the sense system that tracks the position of body parts
- **Vestibular Sense** = the *feeling* of where body parts are
    * *Vestibular* sacs
    * Involved in the sense of balance

### Pain
- **Gate-Control Theory** = a theory that posits that pain signals pass through a kind of "gate" in the spinal chord which can be manipulated to alter the perception of pain
    * Researched by Mel, Zack, and Wall
    * Gate thought to be "opened" by activity of small nerve fibers that send pain signals to the brain
    * Gate thought to be "closed" by activity of large nerve fibers that send signals from the brain

### Taste
- Different tastes = a combination of taste and smell
    * **Unami** = savory
    * **Sweet**
    * **Salty**
    * **Sour**
    * **Bitter**
- **Super-taster** = a person with a lot of taste buds
    * More sensative to tastes
- **Low-taster** = a person with fewer taste buds than normal
    * Insensitive to taste

### Perceptual Illusions
- **Sensory interaction** = one sense interfering with another
- **Muller-Lyer Illusion** = two line segments, if sufficiently separated will appear to be different lengths if
    * One of the line segments has arrows that form an acute angle with the perpandicular
    * One of the line segments has arrows that form an obtuse angle with the perpandicular
- **Ames Room** = uses the **Muller-Lyer** as well as staggered perspective

### Sight and Perception
- **Visual Capture** = the tendency for vision to overpower the other sights
- **Gestalt** = a whole that emerges from disperate parts
    * **Grouping** = the organization of perceptual entities into coherent groups
        + For example, you see a group of people as a whole rather than seeing each individual
        + Principles of grouping
            - **Proximity** = nearby entities are more likely to be grouped
            - **Similarity** = entities with similar properties are more likely to be grouped
            - **Continuity** = items that are whole and continuous are more likely to be grouped
            - **Closure** = grouping tendencies will fill in the gaps
            - **Connectedness** = disperate entities can be grouped if they are conneted or bridged
        + Brain organizes entities into figures and ground
