##Memory construction

### Misinformation Effect:
- filling in gaps with wrong information
    * Information often biased
- Intentional?

### Source Amnesia
- Also called "misattribution"
- Mistaking the source of a piece of information--you imagine it came from another person

### Loftus Experiment
- Wording Effect: wording a piece of information in a certain way can change the perception of the information
- Experiment
    * Two groups: control and experimental
    * Experimental asked how fast two cars where going when they smashed/flew into each other
        + Negative words
    * Control group asked same question with neutral words

### Memories of Abuse
- Can be repressed or even constructed
- Some genuinely forget

### False Memory Syndrome
- A false memory forms the central part of someone's identity
- Can happen by therapist's trusting their clients who tell of trauma

### Theories of how Forgetting Happens:
- Failure to encode information
- Interference by other memories
- Conscious forgetting
- Decay of connections

### Improving Memory
- Retrieval cue frequency
- Consciously rehearse memories shortly after they occurr, so misinformation doesn't tamper with your retrieval
- Minimize interference
