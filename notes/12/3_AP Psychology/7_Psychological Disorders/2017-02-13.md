### Three Types of Schizophrenic Symptoms
1. **Positive symptoms** = an element of cognition that is *added* to the experience of a schizophrenic
    * **Hallucinations** = false perceptions
        + Can help reinforce **delusions**
        + Schizophrenics very often hear *voices*
            - Visual hallucinations are less pervasive
    * **Delusions** = false beliefs, especially of *persecution* or *grandeur*
        + **Delusions of persecution** = the belief that there are people that want to harm you
        + **Delusions of grandeur** = an overinflated ego
        + **Delusions of being controlled** = the belief that cognition itself is compromised by some external entity
1. **Negative symptoms** = an element of cognition that is *removed* from the experience of a schizophrenic
    * Poverty of speech = an ability to speak
    * Flat affect = a lack of emotional expression
1. **Disorganized symptoms** = an element of cognition that involves a perversion of an existing behavior or thought process
    * **Erratic speech** = speech patterns that are irrational
        + **Word salad** = a seemingly random jumble of words that has intention but doesn't make sense
        + **Over-inclusion** = coherent thoughts that jump seamlessly from one disperate idea to another
            - Not like **word salad**, because each individual thought is actual coherent
        + **Paralogic** = faulty logic that reaches absurd conclusions but *feels* correct to the schizophrenic
        + **Clang associations** = unintentional rhyming while speaking
    * **Disorganized behavior** = behavioral patterns that are irrational
        + Inadequate emotional expression
            - *e.g.* Laughing during a funeral
            - Often times, emotions are actually *reversed*, so sad things evoke a happy response
        + **Catatonic behavior**  = a state of complete unresponsiveness
- In addition to these classifications, there are some other terms that used to describe symptoms of schizophrenia
    * **Chronic**/**Process** = a term that describes a pattern where symptoms emerge slowly and increase in magnitude over time
        + Generally, recovery from this kind of schizophrenia is unlikely
    * **Acute**/**Reactive** = a term that describes a pattern where symptoms emerge quickly and rise in magnitude very quickly
        + Generally, recovery from this kind of schizophrenia is much more likely

### Five Types of Schizophrenia
1. **Paranoid schizophrenia**
    * Characterized by obsession with delusions and hallucinations, often with intense paranoia or an inflated ego
2. **Disorganized schizophrenia**
    * Characterized by the disorganized symptoms
        + *e.g.*
            - Word salad
            - Flat affect
3. **Catatonic schizophrenia**
    * Characfterized by a *catatonic* state, extreme negativity, or mimicking other's actions
4. **Undifferentiated schizophrenia**
    * Kind of a catch-all term for schizophrenia that cannot be otherwise classified
5. **Residual schizophrenia**
    * Characterized by withdrawal following the cessation of hallucinations and delusions

### The Dopamine Theory
- A lot of scientists believe that an excess of dopamine can cause schizophrenia
    * As a result, many drugs that target schizophrenia act on reducing the activity of dopamine
    * Dopamine isn't the *sole* cause; other neurotransmitters seem to be related
