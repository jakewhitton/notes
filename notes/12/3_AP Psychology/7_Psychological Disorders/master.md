    * **Atypical** = the behavior isn't exhibited by most people
    * **Disturbing** = the behavior evokes a disturbed response from those who observe it
    * **Maladaptive** = the behavior is counter-productive to one's welfare
    * **Unjustifiable** = the behavior cannot be reasonably pinned on a simple cause

### The Medical Model
- **Medical Model** = a theory of mental illness that emphasizes finding the causes for certain illnesses
    * Treatment is often rather hit-and-miss
        + Lots of different types of treatment

            - Medication
            - Electro-shock therapy
- **Philippe Pinel** = a french person that wrote about how madness was a response to severe stress rather than a demonic ailment

- **Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders(DSM-V)** = widely considered the central authority on what qualifies as a mental illness and how it should be diagnosed

### Prevalence
- About half of adults experience symptoms of a mental illness at one point in their life
- About 80% of those who experienced symptoms in the last year did not seek treatment
    * Generally, men are less likely to seek treatment because of the social stigma
