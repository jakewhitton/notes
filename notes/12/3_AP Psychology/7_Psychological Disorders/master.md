## What is a "Psychological Disorder"?
- There are *four* characteristics
    * **Atypical** = the behavior isn't exhibited by most people
    * **Disturbing** = the behavior evokes a disturbed response from those who observe it
    * **Maladaptive** = the behavior is counter-productive to one's welfare
    * **Unjustifiable** = the behavior cannot be reasonably pinned on a simple cause

### The Medical Model
- **Medical Model** = a theory of mental illness that emphasizes finding the causes for certain illnesses
    * Treatment is often rather hit-and-miss
        + Lots of different types of treatment
            - Psychoanalysis
            - Therapy
            - Medication
            - Electro-shock therapy
- **Philippe Pinel** = a french person that wrote about how madness was a response to severe stress rather than a demonic ailment
- **Thomas Szasz** = a person who wrote that mental illness is a *social* construct rather than a medical phenonenon
    * Is used to ignore problematic patterns of thought or behavior
- **Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders(DSM-V)** = widely considered the central authority on what qualifies as a mental illness and how it should be diagnosed

### Prevalence
- About half of adults experience symptoms of a mental illness at one point in their life
- About 80% of those who experienced symptoms in the last year did not seek treatment
    * Generally, men are less likely to seek treatment because of the social stigma
- Though it is quite common, mental illness is not commonly severe enough to completely debilitate someone
- Women are more likely to experience depression and anxiety
- Men are more likely to abuse substances and experience antisocial personality disorder

### Neurotic vs Psychotic
- **Neurotic** = a term that describes mental illness that causes suffering to people but doesn't impair their ability to think rationally
- **Psychotic** = a term that describes mental illness that distorts people's perceptions of reality or capacity for rational thinking

### Classifying Mental Ilness
- Labels make us feel like those afflicted aren't *human*
    * *e.g.* Suicide hotline will dispatch police if they believe you may harm yourself
        + The autonomy of the depressed person is pretty much ignored
- **David Rosenhan** = ran an experiment where people admitted themselves to a psychiatric hospital and pretended to hear voices
    * All of them were falsely diagnosed with Schizophrenia

#### Anxiety Disorders
- **Anxiety Disorders** = a mental illness that is associated with distress, persistent feelings of anxiety or harmful behaviors that the person performs to reduce feelings of anxiety

##### Why Do Anxiety Disorders Exist?
- **Learning perspective** = anxiety disorders are "learned" from the surroundings as one grows up
    * Explains how phobias can be passed on from parent to child without any genetic component
    * **Fear conditioning** = anxiety disorders arise from associations between harmful stimuli and harmless stimuli
    * **Stimulus generalization** = a phobia developed from conditioning can become broader than the stimuli that first causted it
        + *e.g.* a fear of a white rat can generalize into fear of white, fluffy things
    * **Reinforcement** = an effect of strengthening the association between a harmful stimulus and a harmless one by exerting effort to avoid the causing stimulus
- **Biological perspective** = anxiety disorders can be caused by genetic or physiological factors
    * **Genetic** factors can predispose people to certain phobias
        + Perhaps natural selection is behind some of the most common phobias
    * **Physiology** = anxious symptoms actually manifest in physiological ways
        + Increased heart rate
        + Brain activity
        + Stress hormones

    * Unemployment
    * Loss of health
    * Financial troubles

#### Cognitive Differences in Depressed People
- **A.T. Beck** = a researcher that studied this issue

        + Themselves
        + Their world
        + Their future
    * Depressed people generally perceive situations as *more* negative
- **Hopelessness theory** = a model of explaining depression that emphasizes specific patterns of behavior or cognition
    * "Learned helplessness" = a term that describes how repeated exposure to negative stimuli deccrease the likelihood that a person will look for ways to help their suffering

## Dissociative Disorders
- **Dissociative disorder** = a psychological disorder associated with a separation between conscious awareness and prior identity
- Symptoms typically start early
    * Often the result of abuse of trauma early on
    * Females are more prone to the disorder

### Three Types of Schizophrenic Symptoms
1. **Positive symptoms** = an element of cognition that is *added* to the experience of a schizophrenic
    * **Hallucinations** = false perceptions
        + Can help reinforce **delusions**
        + Schizophrenics very often hear *voices*
            - Visual hallucinations are less pervasive
    * **Delusions** = false beliefs, especially of *persecution* or *grandeur*
        + **Delusions of persecution** = the belief that there are people that want to harm you
        + **Delusions of grandeur** = an overinflated ego
        ++ **Delusions of being controlled** = the belief that cognition itself is compromised by some external entity
1. **Negative symptoms** = an element of cognition that is *removed* from the experience of a schizophrenic
    * Poverty of speech = an ability to speak
    * Flat affect = a lack of emotional expression
1. **Disorganized symptoms** = an element of cognition that involves a perversion of an existing behavior or thought process
    * **Erratic speech** = speech patterns that are irrational
        + **Word salad** = a seemingly random jumble of words that has intention but doesn't make sense
        + **Over-inclusion** = coherent thoughts that jump seamlessly from one disperate idea to another
            - Not like **word salad**, because each individual thought is actual coherent
        + **Paralogic** = faulty logic that reaches absurd conclusions but *feels* correct to the schizophrenic
        + **Clang associations** = unintentional rhyming while speaking
    * **Disorganized behavior** = behavioral patterns that are irrational
        + Inadequate emotional expression
            - *e.g.* Laughing during a funeral
            - Often times, emotions are actually *reversed*, so sad things evoke a happy response
        + **Catatonic behavior**  = a state of complete unresponsiveness
- In addition to these classifications, there are some other terms that used to describe symptoms of schizophrenia
    * **Chronic**/**Process** = a term that describes a pattern where symptoms emerge slowly and increase in magnitude over time
        + Generally, recovery from this kind of schizophrenia is unlikely
    * **Acute**/**Reactive** = a term that describes a pattern where symptoms emerge quickly and rise in magnitude very quickly
        + Generally, recovery from this kind of schizophrenia is much more likely

### Five Types of Schizophrenia
1. **Paranoid schizophrenia**
    * Characterized by obsession with delusions and hallucinations, often with intense paranoia or an inflated ego
2. **Disorganized schizophrenia**
    * Characterized by the disorganized symptoms
        + *e.g.*
            - Word salad
            - Flat affect
3. **Catatonic schizophrenia**
    * Characfterized by a *catatonic* state, extreme negativity, or mimicking other's actions
4. **Undifferentiated schizophrenia**
    * Kind of a catch-all term for schizophrenia that cannot be otherwise classified
5. **Residual schizophrenia**
    * Characterized by withdrawal following the cessation of hallucinations and delusions

### The Dopamine Theory
- A lot of scientists believe that an excess of dopamine can cause schizophrenia
    * As a result, many drugs that target schizophrenia act on reducing the activity of dopamine
    * Dopamine isn't the *sole* cause; other neurotransmitters seem to be related

### Schizophrenia risk: Genetics, Environment, Biology, and Culture
- Scientists believe there is a genetic factor to developing schizophrenia
    * People with no schizophrenic sibilings have a 1% chance of developing symptoms
    * People with one schizophrenic sibiling have a 10% chance of developing symptoms
    * People with an identical twin that is schizophrenic have a 50% chance of developing symptoms
        + Similarly, if *both* parents are schizophrenic, the child is has a 50% chance of developing symptoms
- Scientists also believe there are some environmental factors that increase the risk of schizophrenia
    * Complications during birth
        + *e.g.* Oxygen deprivation
    * Viral infection during pregnancy
- Scientists also beleive there are biological factors that indicate a high risk of schizophrenia
    * An excess or deficit of neurotransmitter
    * **Dopamine theory**
    * Abnormal brain structure
        + Enlarged cerebral ventricles
        + Reduced tissue surrounding the cerebral ventricles
    * Abnormal brain activity
        + Reduced activity in frontal lobe
- There appears to be *no* substantial difference between cultures
    * Industrialized nations have higher incidence and longer recovery times
        + That is thought to be related to stress level
    * Developing nations tend to treat it like a physical illness

## Treatment of Psychological Disorders

### Trephining
- **Trephining** = the act of deliberately creating a hole in the skull
    * Interestingly, this can be a treatment for a physical malady with the brain
        + *e.g.*
            - Fluid buildup
            - Hematoma
- Has been used since ancient times

### Therapy
- **Psychotherapy** = a method of treatment that involves an interaction between a trained therapist and a person suffering from a psychological disorder
    * So, psychotherapy is basically just any type of therapy for mental illness
        + It is not exclusively psychoanalysis; can be cognitive, behavioral, etc
    * Is often characterized by
        + Heavy emotional weight
        + Complete honesty and confidentiality
    * **Eclectic Approach** = the tactic of applying different therapy methods depending on a person-by-person basis
        * Like someone who uses cognitive psychology, biomedical tactics, and psychoanalysis depending on the circumstances

#### Psychoanalysis
- **Psychoanalysis** = a method of psychotherapy developed by Sigmund Freud that analyses how repressed urges or impulses affect emotions and behaviors
    * Has a theoretical basis in his model of personality
    * Is seldom practiced in its original form today
        + Partially because it takes a much longer time to see results
- The essential aim is to surface unconscious motivations and desires
    * Freud believes that conflicts among the **id**, **ego**, and **superego** can cause anxiety
        + Bringing these conflicts to the conscious awareness can permit the patient to resolve the underlying cause of their problems
- According to Freud, *anxiety* is the chief causes for psychological disorders
    * Anxiety is thought to be created when sexual or aggressive impulses are forcefully repressed
    * Guilt is when those impulses are partially but incompletely expressed
- Modern psychoanalytic techniques are often called "psychodynamic therapy" or "insight therapy"
- **Displacement** = the act of directing impulses towards a less threatening or intimidating entity
- **Projection** = the act of justifying one's conflicts by accusing others of having the same behaviors or conflicts
    * *e.g.* If you feel anxious or guilty about a behavior, you might accuse others of the same behavior in order to make yourself feel better
    * Is often a defense mechanism
- **Resistance** = a kind off barrier that barrs the conscious mind from dealing with certain subjects
    * Thought to be an indication of repressed impulses
- **Transference** = a directing of emotional content or conflicts onto the therapist
- **Interpretation** = the collaborative association of behavioral or cognitive patterns with symbolic meaning

#### Humanistic Therapy
- **Humanistic Therapy** = a model of psychotherapy that emphasizes the fundamentally good nature of humans and the potential for **self-actualization**
    * **Self-actualization** = the state of fulfilling one's potential or resolving an ultimate question
- Is often called **Client-centered therapy**
    * **Client-centered therapy** = a method developed by Carl Rogers and Abraham Maslow
        + Characterized by
            - Active listening
            - Genuine interest
            - Empathy
            - Total acceptance
        + Focuses on facilitating personal growth
    * This is because the therapy is more directed by the patient than the therapist
        + The patient can stop at any time, and the patient decides what to talk about
    * The relationship is more co-equal than in other models of psychotherapy

#### Gestalt Therapy
- **Gestalt therapy** = a methodology of psychotherapy that attempts to combine psychoanalysis and humanistic methods
    * Developed by Fritz Perls
        + Thought that humanistic psychology didn't consider role of unconscious at all
- Essential goal is to bring understanding to people's moment-to-moment emotions and motivations
    * Is sometimes called the "being state"
        + Characterized by perfect authenticity and perception of one's motivations and desires

#### Behavior Therapy
- **Behavior therapy** = a methodology of psychotherapy that emphasizes how mechanisms of conditioning can be used to reprogram behavior and thoughts
- **Counter-conditioning** = 
    * **Operant conditioning** = the technique of reinforcing behaviors through punishments and rewards
    * **Classical conditioning** = the technique of associating a two stimuli together to change behavior
        + *e.g.* A baby that observes a rat and hears a loud noise enough times will cry just when they see the rat
        + **Aversive conditioning** = using classical conditioning to reach a positive result
- Essential theory is that *all* behavior is learned
    * And, as a result, behaviors can be re-learned to something better
- Contrasts with both psychoanalysis and humanistic psychotherapy in that it *doesn't* focus on the causes of negative emotions
    * For example, the *cause* of your compulsive behaviors may be an abusive parent
        + But a behavioral therapist would simply retrain you to do a different behavior
- Phobia management techniques
    * **Exposure therapy** = a technique of behavioral therapy that emphasizes recurrent exposure to negative stimuli to desensitize
        + **Immersion** = recreating the negative stimuli in as much sensory detail as possible
            - Also called **flooding**
    * **Systematic desensitization** = a more gradual approach with the same mechanics as **exposure therapy**
        + The process of desensitizing yourself is approached as several steps
            - *first, look at a spider, then let it crawl on your hand, etc*
