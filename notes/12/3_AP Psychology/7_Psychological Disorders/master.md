## What is a "Psychological Disorder"?
- There are *four* characteristics
    * **Atypical** = the behavior isn't exhibited by most people
    * **Disturbing** = the behavior evokes a disturbed response from those who observe it
    * **Maladaptive** = the behavior is counter-productive to one's welfare
    * **Unjustifiable** = the behavior cannot be reasonably pinned on a simple cause

### The Medical Model
- **Medical Model** = a theory of mental illness that emphasizes finding the causes for certain illnesses
    * Treatment is often rather hit-and-miss
        + Lots of different types of treatment
            - Psychoanalysis
            - Therapy
            - Medication
            - Electro-shock therapy
- **Philippe Pinel** = a french person that wrote about how madness was a response to severe stress rather than a demonic ailment
- **Thomas Szasz** = a person who wrote that mental illness is a *social* construct rather than a medical phenonenon
    * Is used to ignore problematic patterns of thought or behavior
- **Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders(DSM-V)** = widely considered the central authority on what qualifies as a mental illness and how it should be diagnosed

### Prevalence
- About half of adults experience symptoms of a mental illness at one point in their life
- About 80% of those who experienced symptoms in the last year did not seek treatment
    * Generally, men are less likely to seek treatment because of the social stigma
- Though it is quite common, mental illness is not commonly severe enough to completely debilitate someone
- Women are more likely to experience depression and anxiety
- Men are more likely to abuse substances and experience antisocial personality disorder

### Neurotic vs Psychotic
- **Neurotic** = a term that describes mental illness that causes suffering to people but doesn't impair their ability to think rationally
- **Psychotic** = a term that describes mental illness that distorts people's perceptions of reality or capacity for rational thinking

### Classifying Mental Ilness
- Labels make us feel like those afflicted aren't *human*
    * *e.g.* Suicide hotline will dispatch police if they believe you may harm yourself
        + The autonomy of the depressed person is pretty much ignored
- **David Rosenhan** = ran an experiment where people admitted themselves to a psychiatric hospital and pretended to hear voices
    * All of them were falsely diagnosed with Schizophrenia

#### Anxiety Disorders
- **Anxiety Disorders** = a mental illness that is associated with distress, persistent feelings of anxiety or harmful behaviors that the person performs to reduce feelings of anxiety
    * People with OCD repeat certain behavioral patterns in order to cope with the feelings on anxiety

##### Generalized Anxiety Disorder
* **Generalized Anxiety Disorder(GAD)** = a catch-all illness that is associated with the following
    + Tense
    + Apphrehensive
    + Abnormally active nervous system

        + Chest pain
        + Sense of choking
        + Shortness of breath

        + Feelings of helplessness
        + Social withdrawal
        + Insomnia

##### Why Do Anxiety Disorders Exist?
- **Learning perspective** = anxiety disorders are "learned" from the surroundings as one grows up
    * Explains how phobias can be passed on from parent to child without any genetic component
    * **Fear conditioning** = anxiety disorders arise from associations between harmful stimuli and harmless stimuli
    * **Stimulus generalization** = a phobia developed from conditioning can become broader than the stimuli that first causted it
        + *e.g.* a fear of a white rat can generalize into fear of white, fluffy things
    * **Reinforcement** = an effect of strengthening the association between a harmful stimulus and a harmless one by exerting effort to avoid the causing stimulus
- **Biological perspective** = anxiety disorders can be caused by genetic or physiological factors
    * **Genetic** factors can predispose people to certain phobias
        + Perhaps natural selection is behind some of the most common phobias
    * **Physiology** = anxious symptoms actually manifest in physiological ways
        + Increased heart rate
        + Brain activity
        + Stress hormones
