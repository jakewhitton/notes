### Schizophrenia risk: Genetics, Environment, Biology, and Culture
- Scientists believe there is a genetic factor to developing schizophrenia
    * People with no schizophrenic sibilings have a 1% chance of developing symptoms
    * People with one schizophrenic sibiling have a 10% chance of developing symptoms
    * People with an identical twin that is schizophrenic have a 50% chance of developing symptoms
        + Similarly, if *both* parents are schizophrenic, the child is has a 50% chance of developing symptoms
- Scientists also believe there are some environmental factors that increase the risk of schizophrenia
    * Complications during birth
        + *e.g.* Oxygen deprivation
    * Viral infection during pregnancy
- Scientists also beleive there are biological factors that indicate a high risk of schizophrenia
    * An excess or deficit of neurotransmitter
    * **Dopamine theory**
    * Abnormal brain structure
        + Enlarged cerebral ventricles
        + Reduced tissue surrounding the cerebral ventricles
    * Abnormal brain activity
        + Reduced activity in frontal lobe
- There appears to be *no* substantial difference between cultures
    * Industrialized nations have higher incidence and longer recovery times
        + That is thought to be related to stress level
    * Developing nations tend to treat it like a physical illness
