#### Gestalt Therapy
- **Gestalt therapy** = a methodology of psychotherapy that attempts to combine psychoanalysis and humanistic methods
    * Developed by Fritz Perls
        + Thought that humanistic psychology didn't consider role of unconscious at all - Essential goal is to bring understanding to people's moment-to-moment emotions and motivations * Is sometimes called the "being state"
        + Characterized by perfect authenticity and perception of one's motivations and desires

#### Behavior Therapy
- **Behavior therapy** = a methodology of psychotherapy that emphasizes how mechanisms of conditioning can be used to reprogram behavior and thoughts
- **Counter-conditioning** = 
    * **Operant conditioning** = the technique of reinforcing behaviors through punishments and rewards
    * **Classical conditioning** = the technique of associating a two stimuli together to change behavior
        + *e.g.* A baby that observes a rat and hears a loud noise enough times will cry just when they see the rat
        + **Aversive conditioning** = using classical conditioning to reach a positive result
- Essential theory is that *all* behavior is learned
    * And, as a result, behaviors can be re-learned to something better
- Contrasts with both psychoanalysis and humanistic psychotherapy in that it *doesn't* focus on the causes of negative emotions
    * For example, the *cause* of your compulsive behaviors may be an abusive parent
        + But a behavioral therapist would simply retrain you to do a different behavior
- Phobia management techniques
    * **Exposure therapy** = a technique of behavioral therapy that emphasizes recurrent exposure to negative stimuli to desensitize
        + **Immersion** = recreating the negative stimuli in as much sensory detail as possible
            - Also called **flooding**
    * **Systematic desensitization** = a more gradual approach with the same mechanics as **exposure therapy**
        + The process of desensitizing yourself is approached as several steps
            - *first, look at a spider, then let it crawl on your hand, etc*
        + Process steps
            1. Progressive relaxation
            2. Organize a heirarchy of increasingly anxiety-inducing experience
            3. Progress through each element in the heirarchy
- **Token economy** = a method of operant conditioning that rewards people with an arbitrary currency
    * Used to a great extent in all kinds of institutions
        + Schools, prisons, etc
