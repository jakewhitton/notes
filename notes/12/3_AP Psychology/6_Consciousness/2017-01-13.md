###  Purpose of Dreams
- In REM sleep, the brain sorts through information
    * Things that are learned through the day are reinforced
        + One reason why the sleep deprivation in students is bad
- REM sleep periods become longer when one is sleep deprived
- Three hypotheses about the purpose of dreams
    1. Dreaming is a maintenance time for the brain to replenish neurotransmitters and other substances and process information
    2. Dreaming is a time for the brain to work out solutions to problems faced in the days
    3. Dreaming is an attempt to organize information faced in the day into a coherent narrative
        * Almost like a computer defragmentating a spinning hard drive
            + SSD master race
