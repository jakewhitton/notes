## What is Personality?
- **Personality** = an individuals patterns of thinking, feeling, and acting
- Four perspectives
    1. **Psychoanalytic** = unconscious processes determine personality
        * *e.g.*
            * Anal retentive
            * Orally fixated
    2. **Humanistic** = personality is determined by self and fleshed out by self actualization
    3. **Social cognitive** = personality is determined by beliefs about one's self
        * e.g.*
            * Insecurity
            * Belonging
    4. **Trait** = personality is determined by the presence of different types of traits

### Psychoanalytic Perspective
- Essential premise is that psychosexual development is integral to our proper functioning
    * If something goes awry at some stage, you may develop a problem with that stage
- Techniques to discover psychosexual problems
    * **Free association** = the process of unearthing unconscious associations between ideas
        + Basically, patient begins chaining ideas as they come to mind
            - Thought to be indicative of unconscious **resistance**
    * **Dream interpretation** = the process of understanding **latent meaning** in dreams
    * **Hypnosis** = inducing a mental state where the unconscious motivations and desires can be seen easier
- **Unconscious** = a storage space for **repressed impulses**
    * **Repressed impulses** = taboo thoughts, wishes, feelings, or memories
    * Is not available to the conscious mind; can only be seen indirectly
- **Preconscious** = a storage space for knowledge that can be invoked but not consciously so
    * Must be brought to memory by some stimulus
    * *e.g.*
        + Events of the day so far
        + Latent knowledge
- Three parts of personality
    1. **Id** = the element that composes our primal element of personality
        * **Pleasure principle** = the heuristic that immediate pleasurable is the most desirable good
        * At birth, the mind is only composed of the id
        * Sources of energy
            + *Eros* = life instinct, perpetuate life
            + *Thanatos* = risky, aggressive, self-destructive drive
        * **Libido** = roughly synonymous with "sex drive"
    2. **Superego** = the element that composes our moral intuition and aspirations
        * Moral intuitions are mostly inherited from observation and imitation
        * It has the power to generate *anxiety*
        * **Morality principle** = the heuristic that adherence to a code is the most desirable good
    3. **Ego** = the element that composes our conscious mind
        * Essential role is to balance the id and superego
        * **Reality principle** = the heuristic that external restrictions should be reconciled for maximum value
- **Psychosexual stages** = stages of development where the id focuses on one type of sensory pleasure

### Five Psychosexual Stages
1. **Oral** = pleasures are principally derived from oral stimuli
    * Birth to 18 months
2. **Anal** = pleasures come from relief from ending discomfort associated with holding in waste
    * 18 months to 36 months
3. **Phallic** = pleasure comes from genitals
    * 3 years to 6 years
4. **Latency** = a period of dormant sexual feelings
    * 6 years to puberty
5. **Genital** = sexual maturation and seeking physical relationships
    * Puberty and after
- **Oedipus complex** = the propensity for a young boy to experience sexual desire for his mother and hatred for his "rival" father
    * Based on the Greek myth of Oedipus
- **Electra complex** = the propensity for a young girl to experience sexual desire for her father and hatred for her "rival" mother
    * Sometimes, your best ideas *don't* come while high on coke
        + Freud loved him some coke
- **Castration anxiety** = a young boy's fear that the father will castrate him for vying for experiencing sexual desire towards his mother
    * *wat.*
- **Penis envy** = the effect of women feeling jealous of men for having a penis
    * Don't ask me.  Freud was weird
- **Identification** = the process by which the dominant parent's values bleed into the superego of the child
- **Fixation** = the effect of having an unresolved conflict during some psychosexual stage
    * Results in a lack of closure--the person fixates on that conflict
- It's important to note that most of these ideas have been discredited and aren't practiced by modern psychodynamic psychologists

### Defense Mechanisms
- **Defense mechanisms** = methods of protection the ego employs to reduce anxiety by distorting perception
- **Repression** = a defense mechanism where anxiety-inducing thoughts are actively fought by the conscious mind
    * Results in those memories being still present, but only to the unconscious
- **Regression** = a defense mechanism where an individual reverts to a psychosexual stage with an unresolved conflict
    * The individual feels less responsibility for their actions
- **Reaction formation** = a defense mechanism where the ego substitutes taboo impulses for their opposites
    * Is a way to avoid situations
        + For example, hiding an impulse that will lead to conflict with its opposite
- **Projection** = a defense mechanism where taboo impulses will be attributed to others
- **Rationalization** = a defense mechanism where unsavory reasons for one's actions are justified with logic rather than the emotions that *really* drive them
- **Displacement** = a defense mechanism where agressive or sexual impulses are directed towards a person or object that is less threatening
    * You deal with your anger at your boss by hurting your spouse, etc
- **Sublimation** = a defense mechanism where harmful impulses are directed into a more socially appropriate activity
    * *e.g.*
        + Lifting weights to deal with anger towards the bourgeoisie
            - *Proletarian gains.*
        + Writing poetry to deal with inappropriate sexual impulses
- **Denial** = a defense mechanism where the negative impulse is simply ignored
    * Is different from repression in that it can still be accessed by the conscious mind
        + It just isn't acknowledged
- **Undoing** = a defense mechanism where the guilt for indulging a negative stimulus is counterbalanced with a positive thing
