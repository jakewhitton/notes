### Defense Mechanisms
- **Defense mechanisms** = methods of protection the ego employs to reduce anxiety by distorting perception
- **Repression** = a defense mechanism where anxiety-inducing thoughts are actively fought by the conscious mind
    * Results in those memories being still present, but only to the unconscious
- **Regression** = a defense mechanism where an individual reverts to a psychosexual stage with an unresolved conflict
    * The individual feels less responsibility for their actions
- **Reaction formation** = a defense mechanism where the ego substitutes taboo impulses for their opposites
    * Is a way to avoid situations
        + For example, hiding an impulse that will lead to conflict with its opposite
- **Projection** = a defense mechanism where taboo impulses will be attributed to others
- **Rationalization** = a defense mechanism where unsavory reasons for one's actions are justified with logic rather than the emotions that *really* drive them
- **Displacement** = a defense mechanism where agressive or sexual impulses are directed towards a person or object that is less threatening
    * You deal with your anger at your boss by hurting your spouse, etc
- **Sublimation** = a defense mechanism where harmful impulses are directed into a more socially appropriate activity
    * *e.g.*
        + Lifting weights to deal with anger towards the bourgeoisie
            - *Proletarian gains.*
        + Writing poetry to deal with inappropriate sexual impulses
- **Denial** = a defense mechanism where the negative impulse is simply ignored
    * Is different from repression in that it can still be accessed by the conscious mind
        + It just isn't acknowledged
- **Undoing** = a defense mechanism where the guilt for indulging a negative stimulus is counterbalanced with a positive thing
