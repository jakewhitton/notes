### Five Psychosexual Stages
1. **Oral** = pleasures are principally derived from oral stimuli
    * Birth to 18 months
2. **Anal** = pleasures come from relief from ending discomfort associated with holding in waste
    * 18 months to 36 months
3. **Phallic** = pleasure comes from genitals
    * 3 years to 6 years
4. **Latency** = a period of dormant sexual feelings
    * 6 years to puberty
5. **Genital** = sexual maturation and seeking physical relationships
    * Puberty and after
- **Oedipus complex** = the propensity for a young boy to experience sexual desire for his mother and hatred for his "rival" father
    * Based on the Greek myth of Oedipus
- **Electra complex** = the propensity for a young girl to experience sexual desire for her father and hatred for her "rival" mother
    * Sometimes, your best ideas *don't* come while high on coke
        + Freud loved him some coke
- **Castration anxiety** = a young boy's fear that the father will castrate him for vying for experiencing sexual desire towards his mother
    * *wat.*
- **Penis envy** = the effect of women feeling jealous of men for having a penis
    * Don't ask me.  Freud was weird
- **Identification** = the process by which the dominant parent's values bleed into the superego of the child
- **Fixation** = the effect of having an unresolved conflict during some psychosexual stage
    * Results in a lack of closure--the person fixates on that conflict
- It's important to note that most of these ideas have been discredited and aren't practiced by modern psychodynamic psychologists
