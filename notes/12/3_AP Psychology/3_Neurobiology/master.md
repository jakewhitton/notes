#Neural Communication

### Biological Psychology
- Discipline of psychology concerned with physical ways neurons cooperate to compose mental processes
- Names:
    * Behavioral Neuroscientists
    * Neuropsychologists
    * Behavior Geneticists
    * Physiological Psychologists
    * Biopsychologists

#### Phrenology
- The study of the shape of skull and the making of inferences based off of that shape
    * Bumps on head indicate abilities or traits
- Developed by Franz Gall

###The Neuron
- Anatomy
    * Soma = body of the cell
        + Receives action potentials from dendrites
    * Dendrites = branching bodies that connect to other dendrites or axon terminals
        + Receive action potentials via **neurotransmitters**
    * Axon = long, thin barrel with myelin sheath that uses electrotonic potential to relay signals from soma to axon terminals
        + Covered with myelin sheath to split transmission into brief, fast electrotonic potentials and connecting action potentials to keep voltage high
    * Myelin sheath = waxy layer composed of **Schwann Cells**
        + Serves to insulate stretches of the axon so that electrotonic potential can happen, speeding up transmisison
    * *Nodes of Ranvier* = gaps inbetween the myelin sheathing that allows an action potential to happen, keeping the voltage within the cell high enough to ensure the signal isn't lost
    * Synapse
        + The area where two neurons come near to each other
        + Cite of neurotransmitter release and intake


### Action Potential
- Begin at resting potential(-70mV inside neuron)
- Stimulus opens Na+ channels and tons of sodium ions flow in
    * **Polarization**
- After a threshold is reached, K+ gates open, letting K+ out.  Voltage drops as a result
    * **Depolorization**
- After a while, Sodium-Potassium pumps begin to create the gradient
    * **Repolarization**

### Drugs that Target Neurotransmitters
- Action potential at dendrite is stimulated by neurotransmitter, typically
- Drugs can fit in those receptors
- **Antagonist**
    * The drug fits, but poorly; as a result, the *real* neurotransmitter can't fit
    * **Inhibits** the targetted neurotransmitter
- **Agonist**
    * The drug fits *really* well and simulates the neurotransmitter
    * **Excites** the neurotransmitter or increases activity

    * Used in learning, memory, and muscle contraction
    * Nicotine is an agonist for Norepinephrine and ACh
    * Thought to be related to Alzheiumer's Disease
        + Decay of memory, reasoning, and lanugage
- Endorphins
    * Regulates pain/pleasure
    * Pain is a stimulus for release
    * Agonists
        + Morphine
        + Codeine
    * Explains "runners high"
- Norepinephrine
    * Excitatory neurotransmitter that causes "fight or flight" response
    * Also related to depression
    * Used in physical arousal, learning, and memory
- GABA
    * Inhibitory
    * Thought to be related to Huntington's disease = death of neurons in *stratium* that make use of GABA
        + Jerky movements
        + Cognitive deterioration
- Glutamate
    * Very prevelant
    * Excitatory neurotransmitter
    * Excess glutamate and lack of GABA is associated with epilepsy


###Neurons can be Excitatory or Inhibitory
- Excitatory = stimulates post-synaptic neuron to carry an action potential
- Inhibitory = Causes post-synaptic neuron to be less likely to start an action potential
    * GABA

## The Nervous System

- **Reflex Arc** = a pathway of nerves through which a reflex happens
    * Generally goes from sensory organ -> affarent neurons -> interneurons -> spinal chord -> interneurons -> efferent neurons -> motor neurons
