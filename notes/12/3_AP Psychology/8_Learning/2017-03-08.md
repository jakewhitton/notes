## What is Learning?
- **Learning** = a persistent change in an organisms behavior
    * At a basic level, learning can be thought about *associations*
        + Kind of similar to **classical conditioning**
            * A **neutral stimulus** preceeds an **unconditioned stimulus**, and the neutral stimulus produces a response to anticipate the unconditioned response

### Classical Conditioning
- **Classical Conditioning**
    * **Unconditioned stimulus(UCS)** = a stimulus that *naturally* triggers a response
        + The dog senses food and salivates
    * **Unconditioned response(UCR)** = an unlearned response that naturally happens as a result of a UCS
    * **Neutral stimulus** = a stimulus that does not trigger a UCR
    * **Conditioned stimulus** = a neutral stimulus that has become a trigger for the desired UCR through a process of classical conditioning
        + The response is now called a **conditioned response**
    * Two steps of classical conditioning
        1. **Acquisition** = the initial stage where the association is made
        2. **Extinction** = the gradual reduction in the strength of the association
    * **Generalization** = the application of a conditioned behavior to a broader set of stimuli then intended
        + *e.g.*
            - a child thinking every tall male person is their dad
    * Conditioning only works when the UCS and neutral stimulus are paired in close proximity during acquisition
