## What is Learning?
- **Learning** = a persistent change in an organisms behavior
    * At a basic level, learning can be thought about *associations*
        + Kind of similar to **classical conditioning**
            * A **neutral stimulus** preceeds an **unconditioned stimulus**, and the neutral stimulus produces a response to anticipate the unconditioned response

### Classical Conditioning
- **Classical Conditioning**
    * **Unconditioned stimulus(UCS)** = a stimulus that *naturally* triggers a response
        + The dog senses food and salivates
    * **Unconditioned response(UCR)** = an unlearned response that naturally happens as a result of a UCS
    * **Neutral stimulus** = a stimulus that does not trigger a UCR
    * **Conditioned stimulus** = a neutral stimulus that has become a trigger for the desired UCR through a process of classical conditioning
        + The response is now called a **conditioned response**
    * Two steps of classical conditioning
        1. **Acquisition** = the initial stage where the association is made
        2. **Extinction** = the gradual reduction in the strength of the association
    * **Generalization** = the application of a conditioned behavior to a broader set of stimuli then intended
        + *e.g.*
            - a child thinking every tall male person is their dad
    * Conditioning only works when the UCS and neutral stimulus are paired in close proximity during acquisition

### Positive Reinforcement and Negative Reinforcement
- **Positive reinforcement** = the addition of a pleasing stimulus to reinforce behavior
- **Negative reinforcement** = the removal of an aversive stimulus to reinforce behavior
- Note that negative reinforcement is *not* the same thing as **punishment**
    * **Punishment** = the addition of an aversive stimulus to inhibit a behavior
        + Two types
            1. **Positive punishment** = the addition of an aversive stimulus to reinforce behavior
            2. **Negative punishment** = the removal of a pleasing stimulus to reinforce behavior
        + Punishment is sometimes effective, but not encouraged
            - Does not teach what the *acceptable* pattern of behavior is
            - Can produce hostility, passivity, or fear
            - Not very durable
            - Models aggression

### Primary Reinforcement and Secondary Reinforcement
- **Primary reinforcement** = a form of operant conditioning that uses unlearned stimuli to reinforce behavior
    * *e.g.*
        + Using sugary foods to positively reinforce behavior by adding a pleasing, unlearned response
        + Using a drug to negatively reinforce behavior by removing an aversive, unlearned response
- **Secondary reinforcement** = a form of operant conditioning that uses learned stimuli to reinforce behavior
    * *e.g.*
        + Using the learned desire to accrue wealth to reinforce behavior

### Schedules of Reinforcement
- **Immediate reinforcement** = a type of reinforcement where the duration between action and reinforcing stimulus is short
    * In contrast to **delayed reinforcers**
- **Continuous reinforcement** = a type of reinforcement where the stimulus and desired behavior are always paired
- **Intermittent reinforcement** = a type of reinforcement where the stimulus and desired behavior aren't always paired
    * Makes the process of learning the behavior more difficult
        + But, when it is learned, it is more durable
    * Also called **partial reinforcement**
- Four types of Reinforcement Schedules
    1. **Fixed ratio** = behavior and reinforcement are paired after a predictable amount of actions
        + *e.g.*
            - Tenth car wash is free!
    2. **Variable ratio** = behavior and reinforcement are paired after an unpredictable amount of actions
        + This proves to be the *most* durable form of reinforcement
            - Because the lack of reinforcement is *expected*
        + *e.g.*
            - Gambling
    3. **Fixed interval** = behavior and reinforcement are paried after a predictable amount of time
        + *e.g.*
            - Wage labor
    4. **Variable interval** = behavior and reinforcement are paired after an unpredictable amount of time
        + *e.g.*
            - Weather
            - Pop quizzes
            - DUI checkpoints

## Cognitive Approach to Learning
- **Latent learning** = a type of learning that isn't conditioned
    * Happens almost by accident
- **Cognitive map** = a mental scheme of a space
    * Studied by E.C. Tolman
- **Overjustification effect** = describes how extrinsic rewards tend to overpower intrinsic rewards
    * For example, if you love playing piano, and then you get a regular paycheck for playing, you motivate yourself with the extrinsic reward
        + Then, if the extrinsic reward is dropped, you have less motivation than you did starting
- **Intrinsic motivation** = the motivation to do something purely because you *enjoy* doing it
    * Generally, this is more *durable* than learned behavior with **extrinsic motivation**
- **Extrinsic motivation** = the motivation to do something purely because you are rewarded or punished if you do do or don't it, respectively
    * Is more prone to "burn-out"
- **Observational learning** = learning by imitation
    * Studied by Albert Bandura
    * **Modeling** = the process of learning a behavior through this means
    * **Prosocial behavior** = constructive, helpful behavior
        * Essentially the opposite of **antisocial behavior**
    * **Mirror neurons** = neurons in the frontal lobe that fire when performing an observed action or observing itself
        + Thought to be an explanation as to why imitation happens
