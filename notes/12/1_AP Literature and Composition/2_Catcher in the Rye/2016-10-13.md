### Three Adults Who Give Holden Advice
- Mr. Spencer
    * Apply yourself
    * Life's a game
- Carl Luce
    * Get help
    * Reach out to a psychoanalyst
- Mr. Antolini
    * Read books

### Mr. Antolini
- I he
    * a caring adult who sincerely tries to help a troubled teen **OR**
    * a predatory adult who tries to seduce a troubled teen
    * Answer: I tend to believe he is a sincere person.  The stranger parts of the scene, I feel, are better explained by the same kind of admiration for younger people that Holden demonstrates towards kids lke Phoebe or the kid tying her skate in central park
