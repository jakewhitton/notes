# Conditional probability

$P(A \vert B)$ = the probability A, given that B occurred

This essentially means "change the sample space to B, and then renormalize the
probabilities so they sum to 1.

In other words,

$$P(A \vert B) = \frac{P(A \cap B)}{P(B)}, P(B) \neq 0$$

## Multiplication rule

$$P\bigg(\bigcap\limits_{i = 1}^{n} A_i\bigg) = \prod\limits_{i = 1}^{n} P\bigg(A_i \bigg \vert \bigcap\limits_{j = 1}^{i - 1} A_j\bigg)$$

## Total probability theorem

If $\{A_i, i \in  \{1, 2, ..., n\}\}$ is a a partition of $\Omega$, then

$$P(B) = \sum_{i = 1}^{k} P(A_i) \cdot P(A_i \vert B)$$

## Bayes' theorem

$$P(A \vert B) = \frac{P(B \vert A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)}$$
