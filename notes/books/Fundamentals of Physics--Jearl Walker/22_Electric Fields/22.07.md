## Dipoles in an $\vec{E}$ Field
- Recall the definition of **dipole moment($\vec{p}$)**:
$$ \vec{p} = q \vec{d} $$
- where $\vec{d}$ is the vector that points from the negative particle of the dipole to the positive one
- Imagine that we put a dipole in a uniform $\vec{E}$ field
    * Then, the direction of $\vec{p}$ makes an angle $\theta$ with $\vec{E}$
    * If we assume the dipole is a rigid body, then we can calculate the net force exerted by the $\vec{E}$ field
$$ \Sigma \vec{F} = \big( -q \vec{E} \big) + \big( q \vec{E} \big) $$
$$ \Sigma \vec{F} = \vec{0} $$
- as such, the dipole actually doesn't experience any net force
    * *however*, the dipole does experience a **net torque**
        + The dipole actually rotates about its center of mass
- **Torque($\tau$)** is defined as
$$ \vec{\tau} = \vec{r} \times \vec{F} $$
- where $\vec{r}$ is the vector pointing from the center of rotation to where the force is being applied
- If we'd like to find the **net torque**, we just add the two torques together
$$ \Sigma \vec{\tau} = \bigg( \vec{r}_{(+)} \times \vec{F}_{(+)} \bigg) + \bigg( \vec{r}_{(-)} \times \vec{F}_{(-)} \bigg) $$
- Remember that our dipole has a vector $\vec{d}$ that points from the negative particle to the positive particle
    * We can create a vector $\vec{k}$ that points from the negative particle to the center of mass
    * Then, we can define $\vec{r}_{(+)}$ and $\vec{r}_{(-)}$ in terms of $\vec{d}$ and $\vec{k}$
$$ \vec{r}_{(+)} = \vec{d} - \vec{k} $$
$$ \vec{r}_{(-)} = - \vec{k} $$
- We can use these equations and the fact that
$$ \vec{F} = q \vec{E} $$
- as substitutions for our earlier equation
$$ \Sigma \vec{\tau} = \bigg( \big( \vec{d} - \vec{k} \big) \times \big( q \vec{E} \big) \bigg) + \bigg( \big( - \vec{k} \big) \times \big( -q \vec{E} \big) \bigg) $$
- One property of cross products is that
$$ \big( \vec{a} \times \vec{b} \big) = - \big( \vec{b} \times \vec{a} \big) $$
- This property is called "anti-communativity"
- Using this, we can rearrange the expresion
$$ \Sigma \vec{\tau} = - \bigg( \big( q \vec{E} \big) \times \big( \vec{d} - \vec{k} \big) \bigg) - \bigg( \big( -q \vec{E} \big) \times \big( - \vec{k} \big)  \bigg) $$
$$ \Sigma \vec{\tau} = - \bigg[ \bigg( \big( q \vec{E} \big) \times \big( \vec{d} - \vec{k} \big) \bigg) + \bigg( \big( -q \vec{E} \big) \times \big( - \vec{k} \big)  \bigg) \bigg] $$
- Another property of cross products is that
$$ \big( f \vec{a} \big) \times \vec{b} = \vec{a} \times \big( f \vec{b} \big) $$
- where $f$ is a scalar
    * Using this, we can rewrite the equation as
$$ \Sigma \vec{\tau} = - \bigg[ \bigg( \big( q \vec{E} \big) \times \big( \vec{d} - \vec{k} \big) \bigg) + \bigg( \big( q \vec{E} \big) \times \big( (-1) ( -\vec{k}) \big)  \bigg) \bigg] $$
$$ \Sigma \vec{\tau} = - \bigg[ \bigg( \big( q \vec{E} \big) \times \big( \vec{d} - \vec{k} \big) \bigg) + \bigg( \big( q \vec{E} \big) \times \big( \vec{k} \big)  \bigg) \bigg] $$
- Another property of cross products is that
$$ \bigg( \vec{a} \times \vec{b} \bigg) + \bigg( \vec{a} \times \vec{c} \bigg) = \vec{a} \times \bigg( \vec{b} + \vec{c} \bigg)$$
- Using this, we get
$$ \Sigma \vec{\tau} = - \bigg[ \big( q \vec{E} \big) \times \bigg( \big( \vec{d} - \vec{k}\big) + \big( \vec{k} \big) \bigg) \bigg] $$
$$ \Sigma \vec{\tau} = - \bigg[ \big( q \vec{E} \big) \times ( \vec{d} ) \bigg] $$
- Using the same property of transitive scalars as we did prior,
$$ \Sigma \vec{\tau} = - \bigg[ \vec{E} \times \big( q \vec{d} \big) \bigg] $$
- Using the definition of $\vec{p}$, we get
$$ \Sigma \vec{\tau} = - \bigg[ \vec{E} \times \vec{p} \bigg] $$
- Using the property of anti-communativity, we get
$$ \Sigma \vec{\tau} = \vec{p} \times \vec{E} $$
- And with that, we have found the net torque of a dipole in a uniform $\vec{E}$ field
    * I'm proud of you, son

## Potential Energy of a Dipole in a Uniform $\vec{E}$ field
- Now that we have a means of calculating the net torque exerted on a dipole, we can determine the potential energy stored in any given permutation
- In order to do so, we can use the definition of **work($W$)**
$$ W = |\vec{F}| d $$
- Adapting it to our situation, we say that $U$ is $W$, $|\vec{\tau}|$ is $|\vec{F}|$, and $\theta$ is $d$
$$ U = |\vec{\tau}| \theta $$
- Note that this formula only applies if $\vec{\tau}$ is constant, which it isn't
    * In order to account for this, we use calculus
    * Consider if we replaced all these terms with differential terms
$$ dU = |\vec{\tau}| d\theta $$
- Then, we could just use the tautology
$$ U = \int dU $$
- With our definition of $dU$ to calculate U
$$ U = \int \bigg( |\vec{\tau}| d\theta \bigg) $$
$$ U = \int \bigg( |\vec{p} \times \vec{E}| d\theta \bigg) $$
$$ U = \int \bigg( |\vec{p} \times \vec{E}| \bigg) d\theta $$
- A property of cross products is that
$$ |\vec{a} \times \vec{b}| = |\vec{a}| |\vec{b}| sin( \theta )$$
- where $\theta$ is the angle between $\vec{a}$ and $\vec{b}$
- As such, we can redefine our integral
$$ U = \int \bigg( |\vec{p}| |\vec{E}| sin( \theta )\bigg) d\theta $$
- Since $$ and $$ are constants, we can factor them out
$$ U =  |\vec{p}| |\vec{E}| \int sin(\theta) d\theta $$
$$ U =  |\vec{p}| |\vec{E}| \big[ - cos(\theta) \big] $$
$$ U = - |\vec{p}| |\vec{E}| cos(\theta) $$
- This is valid, but we can simplify it a bit
    * This actually matches the definition of a **dot product** fairly closely
$$ \vec{a} \cdot \vec{b} = |\vec{a}| |\vec{b}| cos(\theta) $$
- Consider if we re-wrote the equation as
$$ U = - \big[ |\vec{p}| |\vec{E}| cos(\theta) \big] $$
- Then we can just use the definition of dot product to simplify
$$ U = - \big[ \vec{p} \cdot \vec{E} ] $$
- A property of dot products is that
$$ c \bigg( \vec{a} \cdot \vec{b} \bigg) = \big( c \vec{a} \big) \cdot \vec{b} = \vec{a} \cdot \big( c \vec{b} \big) $$
- where $c$ is a scalar
- Using this, we can rewrite the equation as
$$ U = \big( - \vec{p} \big) \cdot \vec{E} $$
- You could place the $-1$ in the $\vec{E}$ if you wish; it really doesn't matter
    * The parentheses are redundant technically, so its often just written as
$$ U = -\vec{p} \cdot \vec{E} $$
- In this form, its assumed the negative belongs to the $\vec{p}$, but, like I said, it *really* doesn't matter
- This equation represents the energy state of a dipole
    * If you want to calculate *work*, you need to take a difference between two states
$$ \Delta U = U_{f} - U_{i} $$

### Microwave Cooking
- Interestingly, this is *exactly* how microwave ovens work
    * The microwave sets up an oscillating $\vec{E}$ field, and the molecules of water in the food try to align themselves
        + As the field is constantly changing, the water molecules accumulate rotational energy
            - This is transfered to its surroundings as heat energy $\to$ hot pockets at 3:00AM
