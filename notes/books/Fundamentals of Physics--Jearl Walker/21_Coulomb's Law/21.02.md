## Charge Is Quantized
- Originally, scientists thought that electric charge was a continuous phenomenon
    * But, because matter is a discrete phenomenon, charge is as well
- **Elementary charge** = the essential "stepping size" that the net charge of an object or particle can increment or decrement by
    * *All* charges can be represented as
$$ n \textbf{e} , n \in \mathbb{Z} $$
    * where
$$ \textbf{e} = 1.602 \times 10^{-19} C $$
- **Quantized** = a word that is meant to convey the discrete nature of a phenomenon
    * things come in "packets" rather than continuously flowing like a substance
