## Gauss' Law and the Behavior of Conductors
- Gauss' law can actually be used to explain phenomenon regarding conductors
    * For example, in a conductor, the free electrons will disperse themselves amongst the outer surface of the object
        + This kind of makes intuitive sense, as like charges repel, and that permutation ensures maximum distance between particles
