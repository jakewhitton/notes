## Gauss' Law and the Behavior of Conductors
- Gauss' law can actually be used to explain phenomenon regarding conductors with excess charge
    * For example, in a conductor with excess charge, the free electrons will disperse themselves amongst the outer surface of the object
        + This kind of makes intuitive sense, as like charges repel, and that permutation ensures maximum distance between particles
- We can demonstrate this fact through Gauss' law
    * Imagine we had a chunk of copper with excess charge q hanging from an insulating thread
    * Now superimpose a Gaussian surface that is *just* inside of the outer surface of the copper
    * Now, if we assume there is no current *inside* the copper, we can deduce that $\vec{E}$ is zero among all points inside of the surface
        + This is because, in order for there to be current, there must be a non-zero force pushing electrons around
            - Which cannot exist without a nonzero $\vec{E}$ field
    * If we make that assumption, then we can use Gauss' law
$$ \epsilon_0 \oint \big( \vec{E} \cdot d\vec{A} \big) = \Sigma q $$
$$ \epsilon_0 \oint \big( \vec{0} \cdot d\vec{A} \big) = \Sigma q $$
- Now, any dot product between a vector and the zero vector($\vec{0}$) is just equal to 0(the scalar this time)
$$ \epsilon_0 \bigg( 0 \bigg) = \Sigma q $$
$$ 0 = \Sigma q $$
$$ \Sigma q = 0 $$
- As such, our excess charge q *cannot* exist *inside* of the chunk of copper
    * Rather, it must exist on the outer surface of it
- We can demonstrate similar properties with different conductor shapes

### Gauss' Law and a Conductor with a Cavity
- The same line of reasoning can be used on a conductor with a cavity
- Imagine a chunk of copper with excess charge q hanging from an insulating thread
    * Now, without changing the charge, remove some material from the core of the material
        + The result is like a tennis ball with thick material; hollow inside but solid on the exterior
- Now, making that same assumption that there is no internal current, we can form a Gaussian surface just inside of the very exterior of the object
    * And, we can conclude the flux is zero, since there cannot be any net flux field if there is no current
        + Then, we use Gauss' law to conclude the charge enclosed by that Gaussian surface is zero
            - As such, the charge must only reside on the very outer surface of the object

### Gauss' Law and a Vanishing Conductor
- Now, imagine you had the hollow chunk of copper from the previous example
    * We know the charge carriers would distribute themselves along the outer surface of the object
    * Now, imagine we expanded the hollow core until the copper conductor simply didn't exist
        * For the purposes of visualization, also assume that the charge carriers didn't move during the process
    * At the very instant where that last shell of copper disappears, the $\vec{E}$ field does not change
        + This is because the $\vec{E}$ field is set up by charges, not by conductors
- The lesson here is that charged particles will try to space themselves as far from one another along the outer surface of an object
    * Not only that, but the particles are practically limited in mobility by the size of the conductor
        + If the conductor were instantly made larger, the particles would bubble up to the outer surface--this time farther apart from one another

### Gauss' Law and Surface Charge Density on Non-spherical conductors
- Recall that the symbol for surface charge density is $\sigma$
- In any spherical conductor, electrostatic equilibrium will be attained the $\sigma$ not changing over the surface
    * This makes sense, because of the nature of the sphere's symmetry
- However, in a non-spherical conductor, things get *interesting*
    * Imagine we had a non-spherical conductor and we selected a differential circular area along that surface
        + Label the differential area $dA$
            - Note that this is distinct from $d\vec{A}$--a vector; $dA$ just represents the patch of area along the surface
- Now, imagine creating a Gaussian cylinder whose bases are parallel to $dA$
    * Since $dA$ is assumed to be infinitesimally small, we can assume that it is essentially flat
    * You can imagine that the cylinder encompasses some enclosed charge q
        + As we have seen in the previous sections, the charge inhabits the surface of the object we are studying which is within our cylinder
    * Then, since $dA$ is a differential area, you can imagine that all the $\vec{E}$ vectors are *perpendicular* to $dA$
    * Then, we can set up Gauss' law, this time in its non-integral form
$$ \epsilon_0 \Sigma \phi = \Sigma q $$
- In order to evaluate $\Sigma \phi$, we can split the cylinder into three surfaces
    * The inner base --- $B_1$
    * The outer base --- $B_2$
    * The curved side --- $S$
- Since $B_1$ resides inside of the conductor, it experiences no flux
- Since $S$ is essentially perpendicular to $dA$, the $\vec{E}$ vectors don't pierce $S$, and it contributes no flux
- Thus, all of the flux comes from $B_2$, the base of the cylinder that lies outside of the conductor
    * We can define $\sigma$ as follows
$$ \sigma = \frac{\Sigma q}{dA} $$
- Using that definition, we can rewrite Gauss' law
$$ \epsilon_0 \Sigma \phi = \sigma dA $$
- Flux can be evaluated just by multiplying the magnitude of the piercing component and the area
    * And, since we demonstrated that flux only comes from $B_2$, we can do that quite easily
        + Note that we assume $dA$ is equal in area to $B_2$, but this is a safe assumption because they are differential areas
$$ \Sigma \phi = |\vec{E}| dA $$
- Using that definition, we can again rewrite Gauss' law
$$ \epsilon_0 |\vec{E}| dA = \sigma dA $$
- Then, we can cancel out the $dA$'s from both sides
$$ \epsilon_0 |\vec{E}| = \sigma $$
- and isolate $|\vec{E}|$
$$ |\vec{E}| = \frac{\sigma}{\epsilon_0} $$
- This formula gives us the magnitude of the $\vec{E}$ field *just* outside of the conductor
