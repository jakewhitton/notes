## Gauss' Law and Planar Symmetry
- Imagine we had an infinite, nonconducting plane with excess positive charge
    * Also assume the surface charge density($\sigma$) is constant throughout the plane
- Let's imagine we wanted to find $\vec{E}$ at a point P that is $d$ units from the plane
    * We can set up Gauss' Law in non-integral form
$$ \epsilon_0 \Sigma \phi = q_{enc} $$
- Our Gaussian surface is going to be a cylinder perpendicular to the plane
    * The curved wall is parallel to $\vec{E}$, so it contributes no flux
    * Instead, the flux comes from the two bases
        + If $\vec{E}$ is constant over the two bases, we can find the flux just by multiplying the surface area with $|\vec{E}|$
            - $\vec{E}$ actually *is* constant over the end caps, because each point is the same distance from the charge source
$$ \Sigma \phi = \big( |\vec{E}| A \big) + \big( |\vec{E}| A \big) $$
$$ \Sigma \phi = 2 |\vec{E}| A $$
- The two bases both have positive flux, because the source charge is positive, and $\vec{E}$ points outward
- Substituting that into Gauss' law, we get
$$ \epsilon_0 \big( 2 |\vec{E}| A \big) = q_{enc} $$
- And, solving for $|\vec{E}|$
$$ |\vec{E}| = \frac{q_{enc}}{2 A \epsilon_0} $$
- But remember that
$$ \sigma = \frac{q}{A} $$
- Making that substitution, we get
$$ |\vec{E}| = \frac{\sigma}{2 \epsilon_0} $$
- And with that, we have a formula for $|\vec{E}|$ just outside of the positively charged infinite sheet
    * Isn't physics *so useful?*
        + I know this can be boring but bear with it
