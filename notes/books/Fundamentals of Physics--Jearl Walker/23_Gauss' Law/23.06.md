## Proving Shell Theorems with Gauss' Law
- As it turns out, we can use this tool to prove the two shell theorems

### First Shell Theorem

> A charged particle outside a shell with charge uniformly distributed on its surface is attracted or repelled as if the shell's charge were concentrated as a particle at the shell's center

#### Proof
