### A Note About This Chapter
- Last chapter was fairly brutal
    * Physics is really about making hard problems easy with abstraction
        + This chapter will be less labor-intensive
- Through *symmetry*, we can skip parts of problems
    * Like how we only summed the vertical components of $d\vec{E}$ in 22.04

## Gauss' Law
- **Gauss' law** = a law that relates net charge of a volume enclosed by a closed surface and the $\vec{E}$ field about that closed surface
    * Discovered by Carl Friedrich Gauss
        + Lived from 1777 until 1855
- Imagine a particle of positive charge q
    * Now superimpose a sphere centered at the particle
        + The surface of the sphere is called a **Gaussian surface**
        + The $\vec{E}$ vectors around the surface point radially outwards
            - Because the particle is *positive*
        + Those same vectors are said to **pierce** the surface of the sphere
- The essential utility of **Gauss' Law** is that we can infer things about the net charge of an object by examining the $\vec{E}$ field about its outer surface
    * Or, equivalently, we can use the net charge to infer information about the $\vec{E}$ about the object's outer surface

### Electric Flux
- **Electric flux** = a metric of *how much* the $\vec{E}$ field *pierces* the Gaussian surface
    * The symbol for **electric flux** is $\phi$
- The best way to learn about this is to just do a bunch of examples
- The $\phi$ is
    * Positive if $\vec{E}$ pierces outward
    * Zero if $\vec{E}$ is parallel to the differential area
    * Negative if $\vec{E}$ pierces inward

#### Electric Flux On a Flat Surface in a Uniform $\vec{E}$ Field
- Imagine we had a uniform $\vec{E}$ field
    * Now superimpose a flat surface of area A
        + Orient it along with yz-plane with its center point at the origin
    * Denote the angle that the uniform $\vec{E}$ vectors make with the x-axis as $\theta$
    * Then, we can imagine splitting the $\vec{E}$ vectors into two components
        + One that *directly* pierces the surface
            - Directly perpendicular to the surface
            - This vector is the **electric flux** for any given differential area
        + One that doesn't pierce the surface at all
            - Directly parallel to the surface
- We can define the magnitude of the electric flux in a subarea of A as
$$ d\phi = |\vec{E}| cos(\theta) $$
- This is valid, but there is a more elegant solution
    * This value can calculated with a **dot product**
$$ d\phi = \vec{E} \cdot d\vec{A} $$
- where $d\vec{A}$ is a vector perpendicular to the surface with a magnitude equal to the area of the surface
- At some points, the $\vec{E}$ field may pierce *into* the surface and in other points, it may pierce outwards
    * In order to find the **net electric flux**, we use integration
$$ \phi = \int \vec{E} \cdot d\vec{A} $$
