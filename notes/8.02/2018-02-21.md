## Electric Potential

### Work Refresher
- **Work** = an imposed change in kinetic energy given by
$$ W_F = \oint{\vec{F} \cdot d \vec{s}} $$
- **Conservative vector field** = a force field such that work is not path dependent
    * *e.g.*
        + Electrostatic force
        + Gravitational force
        + Force of love
- **Non-conservative vector field** = a force field such that the work is path dependent
    * *e.g.*
        + Friction

## Electric Potential
- **Electric potential** = a measure of the potential energy per unit charge contained by a particle
$$ \Delta V_{A \rightarrow B} = - \oint_{A}^{B}{\vec{E} \cdot d \vec{s}}{} $$
