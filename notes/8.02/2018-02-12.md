## Dipoles and Continuous Charge Distribution

### Monopoles
- **Monopole** = any charge element
    * Called a "pole", because field lines either diverge from or converge onto its spacial location
        + Think "north pole"

### Electric Dipole
- **Electric Dipole** = two monopoles of opposite charge, seperated by a distance $d$
- **Dipole moment** = a metric associated with any given electrical dipole
    * Notationally, dipole moment is represented by $\vec{p}$
    * $\vec{r}_-$ is the vector pointing from the midpoint to the negative particle
    * $\vec{r}_+$ is the vector pointing from the midpoint to the positive particle particle
    * Then,
$$ \vec{p} = \sum_{i = 1}^{n} {q_i \vec{r}_i} $$
$$ |\vec{p}| = 2aq, a = |\vec{r}_+| $$
    * Note similarity to formula for center of mass
        + We can't divide by total charge, since that might be undefined(divide by zero)
- Dipoles are a very natural phenomenon
    * Hydrogen atom

## Continuous Charge Distribution
- We can model systems of charged particles by using **charge densities**
    * Same exact idea as moving from discrete elements to mass to continuous mass distributions
    * **$\lambda$** = linear charge density
        + Units: $\frac{C}{m}$
    * **$\sigma$** = surface charge density
        + Units: $\frac{C}{m^2}$
    * **$\rho$** = volumetric charge density
        + Units: $\frac{C}{m^3}$
- Often times, at points of importance with regards to symmetry, we can use that symmetry to simplify the problem
