## Electric Charge
- Electrical charge comes in positive and negative
    * Measured in **Coulombs(C)**
    * The charge of an elementary particle is $e = 1.602 \times 10^{-19} C$
- Charge is also **quantized**
    * Really just a fancy way of saying it only increases in discrete chunks of $e$

## Force Laws in E&M
- Dynamics learned in 8.01 still apply
    * But new force laws will be introduced
- **Coulomb's Law** = force law for charged particles

$$ \vec{F} = \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \frac{q_1 q_2}{r^2} $$

## Fields
- One big difference between 8.02 and 8.01 is that 8.02 is oriented around **fields**
    * **Field** = a function that takes in parameters that span space and returns a value
        + Value can be a vector or a scalar
            - Scalar field examples (temperature map, density map, etc)
            - Vector field examples (wind map, **force field**, etc)
- Generally, force fields obey the principle of superposition

### Field Lines
- **Field line** = a continuous curve that indicates a direction along itself that represents the direction of acceleration at each point in an electrical field
