- Upon powering on, the 8051 will fetch the first instruction from the ROM

## Special Function Registerstt

## Memory bank switching
- Some 8051s have an additional 128 bytes of RAM which can be accessed using a
"indirect address" syntax, where the requested address is placed in a spare
register and prepend the register name with an @ to access the memory address
