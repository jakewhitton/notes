# Review of RAM/ROM trick

The ROM contains minmon, starting at address 0 in the ROM.  When the switch is
set to minmon mode, the ROM is mapped into the lower half of the address space,
and the RAM is mapped into the upper half.

Downloading code to minmon using the serial port puts the binary into the upper
half, starting at 0x8000 (which is where the RAM is mapped when the switch is in
minmon mode).  You can then run the code one of two ways:

1. Issue a goto command to jump program execution to 0x8000
    * This will work as long as you've been careful to ensure that any absolute
    memory addresses are aligned to that address (i.e. don't have jumps that
    will put you back into the middle of minmon)
2. Reset the board and switch into run mode, so that RAM is mapped into 0x0000
and your program will not have to obey any special discipline about absolute
memory addresses

# Serial Port

There are an incredible number of communication schemes available for embedded
systems, but one of the simplest and oldest is RS232 (serial port).

The protocol is **asynchronous**, which means that no clock is sent with the
signal; instead, the client and host must first agree on a **baud rate** that
specifies how many bits will be transmitted each second.

The protocol synchronizes the host and client by using a start bit and a stop
bit to begin and end a transmission

## Hardware on the 8051 to Enable Serial Port Usage

Two buffers exist on the 8051 for storing serial data: the **Serial Buffer
Transmitter** and the **Serial Buffer Receiver**.  Both are referred to as
**SBUF**, but the former can only be written to and the latter can only be read
from, so the names actually don't conflict.

There are several control registers that need to be set to configure the serial
port:

- **TH1** sets which baud rate setting should be used
- **SCON** configures information about what will be sent/received (e.g. to
optionally enable 9-bit transmission)
- **TMOD** configures timers 1 and 0, setting modes about interrupts
- **TCON** configures more information about interrupts
