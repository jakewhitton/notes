## Interrupts

Interrupts are used to briefly transfer execution to a handler routine when some
event happens.  Each interrupt corresponds to a location in the **interrupt
vector**, which is just a region in memory where interrupt sources are
programmed to jump to.

### Polling vs Interrupts

Choosing whether to deal with I/O using polling or interrupts is a trade-off
involving overhead and latency.  For very frequent events, polling is usually
wiser, because the overhead of the effective function call that is done to save
the return address.  For infrequnet events, that overhead is negligible compared
to the overhead you would spend polling, especially if you need a low latency.

### Timing of interrupts

An interrupt will not be accepted iff

- A higher priority ISR is being executed
- The current instruction being executed is a RETI
- The current instruction isn't on the last machine cycle of that instruction
