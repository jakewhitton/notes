# DFA vs NFA
- **DFA** = Deterministic finite automaton
- **NFA** = non-deterministic finite automaton
- Angelic vs Demonic nondeterminism
    * **Angelic non-determinism** = a kind of non-determinism where
      non-deterministic choices are made towards the successful execution of the
      program
    * **Demonic non-determinism** = a kind of non-determinism where
      non-deterministic choices aren't made
        + Used by NFA
