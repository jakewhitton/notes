# Why is studying OS's interesting?
- Tradeoffs
    * Efficiency vs portability (or abstraction or convenience)
    * Power vs simplicity
    * Flexibility of use vs security
- Difficulty and uniqueness of task
    * You're writing bare metal C without the aid of any syscalls
- New hardware constantly opens up new opportunities for OS innovation

# How is this course structured
- Lectures explore ideas in OS construction, the inner workings of xv6
- Labs exercises our understanding of the material
    * Labs are split between **system programming**, **os primitives**, and
      **os extras**
- Reading papers covers modern topics in OS construction
- There are **two** exams
    * Midterm (in class)
    * Final
- 6.828 vs 6.S081
    * 6.828 will be pure research topics in the future
    * 6.S081 will be the undergrad version that will be available in the future

# Roles of operating systems
1. Abstract hardware features behind a simple interface
2. Multiplex/multitask programs
3. Isolation of programs from one another
4. Supply primitives for sharing between processes
5. Orchestration of sharing and isolation primitives in such a way that provides
   security and performance

# Core ideas of developing operating systems
- **Abstraction** = the principle of 
    * In operating systems, oftentimes abstractions are created that don't map
      neatly onto hardware features
        + e.g. a filesystem has concepts of permissions and distinctions between
          different types of data, but the disk is just a opaque binary storage
- **Kernel** = embodies the notion that the OS should be entirely separate from
  the programs that run on it
    * **User-space vs Kernel-space** = the idea that encapsulates this
      separation
        + User-space contains things like running programs, text editors,
          compilers, etc
        + Kernel-space contains things like process control, device drivers,
          file systems, and the code that directly talks to hardware
    * **System call interface** = the collection of syscalls that allow
      userspace programs to trigger desired functionalities in the kernel
        + **System call** = an instruction in program whose opcode does not
          exist in the CPU's ISA but does have meaning to an operating system
            - Recall from 6.004
        + Modern OS's have hundreds of system calls available
            - This class focuses on a much smaller core set that has existed for
              decades (*i.e.* POSIX)

# xv6
- **xv6** = a UNIX-like OS that is small enough to understand completely
    * Borrows UNIX ideas like file descriptors
        + **File descriptor** = an integer that represents a process's ownership
          over a file or resource
            - 0 is always *stdin*
            - 1 is always *stdout*
            - A mapping between a proccess's file descriptors and their referent
              objects is maintained in a kernel table

## Tale of two syscalls: fork and exec
- **fork** = a syscall that generates a complete copy of the execution state for
  the current process and then returns an integer that communicates which
  process follows
- **exec** = a syscall that overwrites the virtual address-space of the current
  process with the contents of a binary that is specified in a parameter
- The combination of these two, along with wait, allows you to build a shell
    * **wait** = a syscall that will return when a child process exits
