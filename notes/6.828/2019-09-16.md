# How do syscalls work?
- Syscalls have a one-to-one correspondence with actual routines in the kernel
  executable
    * *So, why not just call those methods from our program?*
        + Answer: isolation cannot be maintained with a simple routine call
        instruction

## Isolation
- **Isolation** = the principle that processes that run in userland should not
  have the ability to interfere with each other's execution
    * This is achieved using a few techniques
        + **Address space** = the space of userland memory locations that a
        process can touch
        + **Privelege mode** = hardware support for conditionally enabling
        access to hardware based on a running program's privelege
        + **Well-written syscall code** = a kernel's implementation of the
        syscall interface is the main threat surface when isolation can be
        compromised

### Tale of a syscall
- Issuing a syscall follows the same calling convention that normal procedure
  calls do
    * Arguments go into the registers a0-a*n*
- `ecall` instruction does several things
    * Saves userspace PC into special register used exclusively for that purpose
    * Sets PC to an instruction address register that is populated by the kernel
        + That address points to the **trampoline**, the region of userspace
        memory that performs part of the transition to supervisor/kernel mode
            - The code in the trampoline backs up userspace execution state into
              another region of userspace memory caled the **trapframe**
    * Sets cpu to **supervisor mode**
        + **supervisor mode** = the level of hardware privelege that enables
        unrestricted access to hardware resources (*e.g.* memory)
- Once ecall moves execution to the trampoline, user execution state (registers,
  PC, *etc*) get backed up into the trapframe
- Once user execution state is saved to the trapframe, execution switches to
  `usertrap`, which is located in the kernel
    * This does some additional processing on the trapframe and then uncovers
    the reason why a usertrap was triggered (maybe a hardware exception, a
    syscall, or a timer interrupt) and dispatches to the correct piece of kernel
    handler code for that reason
