## Transcription

### Before transcription
- **Transcriptome** = the set of all RNA molecules in a cell
- Prior to transcription, the DNA is wound up in the chromosome
    * Histones are very positive proteins, and DNA phosphates are negative, which is why DNA wraps around them
    * **Chromatin** = the histones and DNA in one bundled matrix
    * Two ways to modify chromatin
        1. **Acetylation** = add an acetyl group onto Lysine
            + **Upregulation** = increases activity of transcription
            + Forms **Heterochromatin**
        2. **Methylation** = add a methyl group onto certain bases
            + **Downregulation** = decreases activity of transcription
            + Forms **euchromatin**
### After transcription
- **5' capping** = a modification to the 5' end
    * The 5' terminal nucleotide actually maintains it's three phosphates
        + Because RNA polymerase doesn't attach first nucleotide to a primer, the triphosphate stays intact
    * This process happens soon after transcription begins
        + Because the 5' end will be left in cytoplasm as the rest of the mRNA is synthesized
- **3' polyadenylation** = a modification to the 3' end
    * First, mRNA is cleaved at a poly(A) site
    * Then, a few hundred adenines are added to the end of the 3' end
        + Called a **Poly-A Tail**
        + This is because degradation of the 3' end will happen naturally over time
            - This process will make it so the degredation will only damage non-coding regions for a while
        + The poly-A tail is used as a marker for nuclear export
- **Splicing** = the removal of segments(called **introns**) from pre-mRNA
    * **Intron** = non-coding region of pre-mRNA
    * **Exon** = coding region of pre-mRNA
