## Cell Size
- Cells can range from 10$\mu$m to a few mm
    * Prokaryotes(bacteria and archea) are on the smaller end
    * Eukaryotes are on the larger end
        + Frog egg cell is commonly used in experiments, because of it's large size

### Prokaryotic Cells
- Defined as cells that don't have a nucleus
- Unicelluar and typically are 1$\mu$m-10$\mu$m
- Possess a plasma membrane **and** a cell wall
    * Cell wall makes cell rigid and acts as defense against **osmotic shock**
        + **Osmotic shock** = stress caused by water coming in or out of the cell too quickly

### Eukaryotic Cells
- Defined as cells that possess a nucleus and well-defined organelles
- Can be much larger than prokaryotes(typically 10$\mu$m-100$\mu$m)
    * Size is bounded below(*i.e.* it cannot be too small) by **surface-area-to-volume ratio**
        + Need enough surface area at plasma membrane to absorb nutrients and export toxins
    * Size is bounded above by stability
- Must have a way to regulate osmotic pressure
    * Solution is protein-based pumps

### Origins of Eukaryotic Cells
- **Endosymbiotic Theory** = idea that symbiotic relationships between prokaryotes developed and eventually turned into organelles
    * Also called "endosynbiont theory"
    * Evidence
        + Mitochondrial DNA is a circular chromosome
        + Mitichondria have ribosomes that are like those of prokaryotes

### Linkage
- **Linkage** = an effect of when genes are arranged linearly on a chromosome
    * If they are in proximity on chromosome, they become *linked*
        + This means that they will sort *dependently*

### Crossing Over
- During aligning of chromosomes in meiosis, if genes aren't linked, individual alleles can swap over
    * The class of gametes with with these swapped alleles are called **recombinant**
    * **Recombinant frequency** = the percentage of gametes that are recombinant
        + The closer two genes are, the less likely the genes are to cross over
            - This means that the recombinant frequency will be lower
        + We can use recombinant frequences to get the distance between gene sequences on the chromosome
