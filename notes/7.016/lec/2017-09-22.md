## Proofreading in DNA Replication
- DNA Polymerase has an exonuclease that can correct the prior-inserted base
    * But can *only* correct previously placed base
- **Base excision repair**
    * Base pair is broken, nucleotide is "pivoted" away from double helix, and base is replaced
- **Nucleotide excision repair**
    * When UV light hits adjacent Thymines, a covalent bond happens, forming a "thymind dimer"
    * The surrounding bases are removed, and new DNA is laid down
    * **Xeroderma pigmentosum** = an autosomal recessive genetic disease that is caused by a defect in the genes that code for proteins involved in nucleotide excision repair

### Telomeres
- **Telomeres** = the tips of chromosomes that fail to get replicated typically
    * This is a consequence of the fact that DNA polymerase needs a primer in order to start adding DNA
        + On 3' end, primer is laid down at very end, so that primer will never be overwritten with DNA
            - Because you cannot put down a primer after the strand ends
        + **Telomerase** = an enzyme that can actually fill in RNA primers
            - Important in stem cells and gametes

## Transcription
- Faithful transcription of DNA is *less* important than in replicating DNA
    * This is because many, many mRNA transcripts are produced, so it's likely that enough will get it correct
- RNA actually have the freedom to form more interesting shapes
    * Unlike DNA
- In eukaryotes, transcription takes place in nucleus, in prokaryotes, in nucleolus
- Steps
    1. Instead of RNA polymerization starting at a primer, RNA Polymerase binds to a **promoter**
        * **Promoter** = a non-coding section of DNA that is used as a origin for transcriptiont
        * RNA polymerase actually has a helicase built in as well
        * Only the "template" strand of the double-stranded DNA is ever transcribed
        * Only about 1.5% of DNA actually codes for proteins; the rest is control information
        * A lot of DNA sequences are involved giving information as to where transcription should happen
            + *e.g.* TATA box
    2. RNA polymerase continues to add nucleotides and backbone is synthesized
    3. Eventually, RNA polymerase breaks hydrogen bond between itself and the DNA
