## Physical Encoding of Bits
- We've talked about how to use bits in an abstract sense
    * Now, we're interested in how we should represent them in physical systems

### What Do We Want in a Physical Bit System?
1. Cheap & Small
    * We will need a **lot** of them
2. Stable
    * State doesn't change unless we tell it to change
3. Ease of manipulation
    * Operations like access, inverse, moving, *etc*
- In addition, we should use things that are studdied in EECS
    * *e.g.*
        + Voltages(what we'll use)
        + Currents
        + Phase
        + Frequency

### Example: Voltage Representing a Grayscale Image
- Let each pixel have an analog value between 0V and 1V
    * *Question: how much information does one pixel's value contain?*
- **Operation blocks** = a bundle of functionality that maps one pixel voltage to a resultant voltage
    * Repeated application of operation blocks using analog signals will have a compounding error effect in the presence of ANY noise
        + The solution is digital systems
            - This abstraction permits our systems to tolerate reasonable amounts of noise and physical imperfection

#### What Causes Noise?
- Things like
    * Parasitic resistance
    * Inductance
    * Capacitance
    * IR drop
    * External EM fields

## Digital Processing Element
- **Digital processing element** = a **combinational device** with
    * One or more **digital inputs**
    * One or more **digital outputs**
    * A **functional specification**
        + **Functional specification** = essentially a truth-table that defines how the element maps inputs to outputs
    * A **timing specification**
        + **Timing specification** = the amount of time it takes for digital processing to take place
            - Most modern logic gates take no more than $10ps$
- A device is a digital processing element
    1. Each element is a digital processing element
    2. Every input is connected to exactly one output or to some vast supply of constant voltage(1 or 0)
    3. Must not contain cycles
        * *Why?*

## Attempts at a Solution

### Attempt 1
- Central idea is to create a threshold $V_{TH}$ such that
    * If $V < V_{TH}$, then it is a 0
    * If $V > V_{TH}$, then it is a 1
- Downside
    * It is nearly impossible to distinguish $V + \epsilon$ from $V - \epsilon$

### Attempt 2
- Central idea is to create two thresholds $V_L$ and $V_H$ such that
    * If $V < V_L$, then it is a 0
    * If $V < V_H$, then it is a 1
- Is a much better system because there is no point where a small noise disturbance can sway the result
- Downside
    * The middle range is ambiguous

### Attempt 3
- Central observation is that input processing is the only time when bit interpretation needs to happen
    * Thus, we need a wider margin for input margins than for output margins
    * If digital signal represents and output, then
        + If $V < V_{OL}$, then it is a 0
        + If $V > V_{OH}$, then it is a 1
    * If digital signal represents and input, then
        + If $V < V_{IL}$, then it is a 0
        + If $V > V_{IH}$, then it is a 1

## Buffers
- **Buffer** = a digital processing element that takes in an analog signal and outputs a digital voltage
- **Voltage Transfer Characteristic(VTC)** = a graph of input voltage vs inte
    * Note
        1. The VTC behavior in the "forbidden zone" can be anything, as those aren't valid function inputs anyways
        2. The forbidden zone in the VTC must be taller than it is wide
            * Specifically, $V_{OH} - V_{OL} > V_{IH} - V_{IL}$
            * Result
                1. Combinational device must have **gain** > 1
                2. Combinational device must be nonlinear
