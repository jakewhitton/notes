## CMOS Technology

### MOSFETs
- **MOSFETs(Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor Field-Effect Transistor)** = four-terminal device that allows current to flow between **diffusion terminals** if **gate terminal** voltage is high enough
    * **Diffusion terminals** = the logical input and output of a MOSFET
        + **Drain** = the terminal where an input signal is placed
        + **Source** = the output terminal which either receives the source signal or doesn't, depending on the value at the gate terminal
    * **Gate terminal** = the terminal that lies right above the channel of Silicon that seperates the drain and source
        + Placing a positive voltage on the gate creates attractive force that permits electrons to flow from the drain to the source
    * **Bulk terminal** = connection to either ground or $V_{CC}$ depending on what type of FET

#### NFET vs PFET
- **NFET** = diffusion terminals are of N type and substrate is of P type
    * Bulk should connect to ground
- **PFET** = diffusion terminals are of P type and substrate is of N type
    * Bulk should connect to $V_{CC}$

### "Complementary MOS"
- Two MOSFET circuits are complementary when exactly one circuit conducts for any given permutation of inputs

### CMOS and Inversion
- Generally, MOS circuits are designed with a **pull-up circuit** and a **pull-down circuit**
    * **Pull-up circuit** = composed of PFETs which conduct on 0
    * **Pull-down circuit** = composed of NFETs which conduct on 1

### Propogation Delay and Contamination Delay
- **Propogation delay($T_{PD}$)** = the maximum amount of time a FET device will take to convert valid input to valid output
- **Contamination delay($T_{CD}$)** = the minimum amount of time a FET device will take to produce an invalid output once an input becomes invalid
    * Measure of gain?
    * Why minimum?
