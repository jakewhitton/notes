## Combinational Logic
- **Standard Cell Library** = the collection of FET circuits that are used to create higher level components
    * Think *standard library* in a programming language like C++
- The purpose of this lecture is to begin using a small standard cell library to begin synthesizing logical systems

### Functional Specifications
- There are many ways to describe how a logical element should behave
    * "Word description" just means that you describe the relationship between
    * **Truth table** = an exhaustive listing of each permutation of inputs and the corresponding outputs
    * **Boolean expression** = a formula using boolean algebra operations(AND, OR, NOT)
$$ Y = \overline{A} \cdot B + C $$
        + **Sum-of-Products** = a boolean expression composed of several sub-expressions, connected by OR's, that are themselves composed of compund AND's
            - For ANY truth table, you can represent the function by a sum-of-products with one term for each 1 in the output column of the truth table

### Logical Universality
- If a set of gates can be used to encode any logical computation, the set is called **logically universal**
    * *e.g.* NAND is logically universal

### Demorgan's Laws
$$ \overline{A} \cdot \overline{B} = \overline{A + B} $$
$$ \overline{A} + \overline{B} = \overline{A \cdot B} $$

### Leniency
- What is leniency?

### Multiplexer
- **Multiplexer** = a logical element that has a control bus which specifies what input to forward out to and output
