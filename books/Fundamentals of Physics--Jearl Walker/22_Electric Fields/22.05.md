### The Electric Field Due to a Charged Disk
- The last section was about *linear* charge densities
    * This one will use the same methodology with **surface charge density($\sigma$)**
        + DON'T FREAK OUT; we don't have to go through that whole procedure again


#### The Problem
- Imagine a circular disk of radius R and uniform charge $q$ described by $\sigma$ and a point P along the central axis
    * Now, superimpose a ring of radius $r$ and charge $dq$
        + *Do you see where this is going?*
    * We know that the $\vec{E}$ exerted on P by the differential ring is
$$ \vec{E} = \frac{z q_{total}}{4 \pi \epsilon_0 \big( R^2 + z^2 \big)^\frac{3}{2}} $$
- Making the appropriate substitutions, we get

$$ d\vec{E} = \frac{z dq}{4 \pi \epsilon_0 \big( r^2 + z^2 \big)^\frac{3}{2}} $$
- Now, we just have to define $dq$ in terms of our integrating variable, $r$
- Consider the following
$$ dq = \sigma (2 \pi r) dr $$
- This just indicates that our differential charge along each ring is equal to the surface charge density multiplied by the differential area that ring occupies
- Making that substitution,
$$ d\vec{E} = \frac{z \sigma (2 \pi r) dr }{4 \pi \epsilon_0 \big( r^2 + z^2 \big)^\frac{3}{2}} $$
$$ d\vec{E} = \bigg[ \frac{z \sigma (2 \pi r) }{4 \pi \epsilon_0 \big( r^2 + z^2 \big)^\frac{3}{2}} \bigg] dr $$
$$ d\vec{E} = \bigg[ \frac{z \sigma r }{2 \epsilon_0 \big( r^2 + z^2 \big)^\frac{3}{2}} \bigg] dr $$
- Now, we integrate both sides
$$ \int d\vec{E} = \int \bigg[ \frac{z \sigma r }{2 \epsilon_0 \big( r^2 + z^2 \big)^\frac{3}{2}} \bigg] dr $$
- Much of the integrand is composed of constants, which we can factor out
$$ \int d\vec{E} = \frac{z \sigma}{2 \epsilon_0} \int \bigg[ \frac{r}{\big( r^2 + z^2 \big)^\frac{3}{2}} \bigg] dr $$
- We can solve this integral by using u-substitution
$$ u =  $$
